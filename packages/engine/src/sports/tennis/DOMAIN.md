# Tennis — domain audit (W4, #407)

**Module** `tennis@1.0.0`, built on the nested kernel (`nested/kernel.ts` —
points → games → sets, the only kernel in the engine with a game layer).
**Variants:**

- `tour` (default) — best of 3 tie-break sets, tie-break at 6–6 to 7, advantage
  games;
- `grand-slam` — best of 5, the deciding set plays normally but its tie-break at
  6–6 runs to 10;
- `fast4` — sets to 4 games, tie-break at 3–3 to 5, no-ad games;
- `doubles-noad-mtb10` — no-ad games and a 10-point **match tie-break** that
  replaces the deciding set (the ITF doubles norm).

**Audited against:** the ITF *Rules of Tennis* (Rule 5 "score in a game",
Rule 6 "score in a set", Rule 7 "score in a match", Rule 21 "the let",
Rule 30 "continuous play"), Appendix VI (alternative procedures — no-ad, short
sets, match tie-break) and Appendix VII / the ITF *Duties and Procedures for
Officials* — i.e. the **chair umpire's card**: point-by-point boxes, the server
column, the ace / double-fault marks, the code-violation box, the change-of-ends
ticks and the signature line.

## Mapping table

| fact | variants | who/what participates | schema path | status | note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A point is won | all | entrant | `Ev.Point.by` | modelled | |
| Point calls 0 / 15 / 30 / 40 | all | entrant | `State.points` (`kind: "standard"`), `gameScoreLine` | modelled | the display speaks tennis. |
| Deuce and advantage | tour, grand-slam | entrant | `State.points.advantage` | modelled | advantage back to deuce is folded, not derived. |
| No-ad: one deciding point at deuce | fast4, doubles-noad-mtb10 | entrant | `Cfg.game.noAd` | modelled | |
| Receiver's choice of side at the deciding point | fast4, doubles-noad-mtb10 | entrant | `Ev.Point.meta.receiverSide` | modelled | recorded for the record; ITF App VI. |
| Games won inside a set | all | entrant | `State.games` | modelled | |
| Set won at 6 games, by two | tour, grand-slam | entrant | `Cfg.set.gamesTo`, `Cfg.set.winBy` | modelled | |
| Short sets to 4 | fast4 | entrant | `Cfg.set` (variant `fast4`) | modelled | ITF App VI. |
| Tie-break game at 6–6 to 7, win by 2 | tour, grand-slam, fast4 | entrant | `Cfg.set.tiebreakAt`, `.tiebreakTo`, `Cfg.tiebreak.winBy` | modelled | `fast4` enters at 3–3 and plays to 5. |
| Deciding-set tie-break to 10 at 6–6 | grand-slam | entrant | `Cfg.finalSet.tiebreakTo` | modelled | the real slam rule, not an approximation. |
| Match tie-break replacing the deciding set | doubles-noad-mtb10 | entrant | `Cfg.finalSet.matchTiebreakTo` | modelled | banked as `ClosedSet.mtb`, printed `[10–7]`. |
| Advantage (open-ended) final set | configurable | entrant | `Cfg.set.tiebreakAt = null` | modelled | no shipped variant uses it; the kernel supports it. |
| Match won at 2 sets (3 in a slam) | all | entrant | `Cfg.bestOf`, `State.setsWon`, `outcome.kind = "win"` | modelled | tennis never draws. |
| Which side is serving | all | entrant side | `State.serving`, `summary.detail.serving` | modelled | alternates each game; after a tie-break the first tie-break server receives. |
| Tie-break serve rotation (one point, then two each) | all | entrant side | `State.tbPointsPlayed`, `State.tbFirstServer` | modelled | ITF Rule 5b. |
| **Which player** served the point | all | person `server` | `Ev.Point.server` → `State.persons[id].serves` | extended | optional `PersonId`. The chair's card has a server column; in doubles the side alone cannot say who served. |
| **Which player** won the point | all | person `scorer` | `Ev.Point.scorer` → `State.persons[id].points` | extended | optional. `scorer` is the engine-wide name for the person credited with a point; `winner` is an EntrantId everywhere else (`MatchOutcome.winner`). `Ev.Point.meta.kind = "winner"` keeps the word where tennis really uses it — the *shot type*. |
| Leaderboard credit from a stream naming only the entrant (`Ev.Point.by`), no `server`/`scorer` at all | all | entrant, via `PlayerStatsFoldCtx.personsOf` | `playerStats.metrics[points_won]` (`entrantField: "by"`, `fromEntrant: true`) + `playerStats.folded` (`matches`, `sets_won`, `sets_lost`, `games_won`) | extended | S8/#417, the nested-kernel twin of the same row in `DOMAIN.volleyball.md`/`.badminton.md`/`.tabletennis.md`. An explicit person field still wins whenever one resolves; only when it names nobody does `by`'s entrant get looked up through the caller-supplied roster, gated on the entrant's KIND inside the engine (tennis's own `entrantModel.kinds` never offers "team", but the guard is inherited from the shared engine boundary regardless). `matches`/`sets_won`/`sets_lost`/`games_won` are match/set/game OUTCOMES a metric+field walk over individual events cannot express, so they replay the same `applyStandardPoint`/`applyTbPoint`/`applySetSummary`/`applyGameAward` the live fold uses, off a synthetic two-entrant state — never a second, parallel implementation of the scoring cascade. |
| Ace | all | person (the server) | `Ev.Point.meta.kind = "ace"` + `Ev.Point.server` → `State.persons[id].aces` | extended | the shot type was already modelled; W4 makes it attributable. |
| Double fault | all | person (the server) | `Ev.Point.meta.kind = "double_fault"` + `Ev.Point.server` → `State.persons[id].doubleFaults` | extended | credited to the **server** even though the receiver wins the point — that is how the card scores it. |
| Winner / unforced error | all | person `scorer` | `Ev.Point.meta.kind`, `Ev.Point.scorer` | modelled | the shot type already existed; attribution now rides with it. |
| Code violation ladder: warning → point penalty → game penalty → default | all | entrant + optional person | `Ev.Sanction.level`, `.person`, `.reason` → `State.sanctions[]`, `summary.detail.sanctions`, `discipline.extractCards` | extended | new `tennis.sanction` event; never moves the score. `reason` is optional free text and reaches the discipline projection only — the fold never reads it, so no recorded state moves. |
| The point a **point penalty** concedes | all | entrant | recorded as a `tennis.point` for the opponent | modelled | as the chair writes it into the card. |
| The game a **game penalty** concedes | all | entrant | `Ev.GameAward.winner` → `State.games`/`.points`/`.serving`/`.sets` (via the existing `winGame`); error `GAME_AWARD_DURING_TIEBREAK` | extended | S5 (#431) — new `tennis.game.award` event, one level up from the point-penalty pattern above: `tennis.sanction{level:"game_penalty"}` stays a pure no-op on score (`applySanction`, unchanged), and this event carries the scoring consequence, entered alongside it. `winner`, not `by` — `NestedSanction.by` names the offender; this field names the entrant credited with the game, the engine-wide `winner` convention (`MatchOutcome.winner`). Calls the existing `winGame` directly, so no new fold logic and no new `State` field. Refuses mid-tie-break and mid-match-tie-break: the breaker itself IS the deciding game (`games` holds at 6-6 through a regular tie-break), so conceding a set there is a genuinely different, undesigned cascade — a deliberate, named boundary, not a silent gap. See `_INDEX.md`'s 2026-08-11 S5/#431 decision-log entry for the ruling context. |
| The specific code-violation offence (racquet abuse, audible obscenity, coaching, time violation, …) | all | person | `Ev.Sanction.reason` (free text) | deferred | still deferred as a *taxonomy*: the ITF offence list is long and tour-specific, and a closed enum needs a product decision plus four locale dictionaries. W4's review added the free-text `reason` so the chair's own words reach `DisciplineCard.reason` — which is what an accumulation rule keyed on the offence ("three for racquet abuse") actually needs. Carrom's dossier records the same compromise. **Reconsidered and reaffirmed in S4 (#428)**: adopting now risks the "enum guessed at from broadcast vocabulary" anti-pattern the S4 prompt itself warns against — ITF/ATP/WTA top-level categories (~12-14: audible/visible obscenity, verbal/physical/ball/racket abuse, coaching, unsportsmanlike conduct, time violation, best efforts, leaving court…) vary by tour/division in exact codification and fine schedule. The researched category list is recorded in `_INDEX.md` as a starting point for a future session with a real product ask. |
| Break of serve | all | entrant | derived from `State.serving` + `State.games` | modelled | the card marks it; the ledger already determines it. |
| First serve vs second serve | all | person | — | deferred | the chair's card records only the outcome (a double fault). First-serve percentage is a broadcast statistic, wrong fidelity for our tiers. |
| Lets | all | — | — | deferred | a let is replayed and nothing is written — there is no scoresheet fact to record. |
| Challenges / electronic review | all | person | — | deferred | Hawk-Eye venues only, and electronic line calling has removed challenges from most tour events. Niche; wrong fidelity for club play. |
| Change of ends (odd games; every 6 points in a tie-break) | all | — | — | deferred | fully derivable from the games and points played; procedural, no fold consequence. |
| Medical timeout, toilet break, heat rule | all | entrant + optional person | `Ev.Interruption.kind`, `.by`, `.person`, `.duration` → `State.interruptions[]`, `summary.detail.interruptions` | extended | new `tennis.interruption` event (W4a §5.4). `duration` is recorded explicitly, not derived: a three-minute limit must not drift when the chair taps late. Never moves the score — a delay penalty is entered as the point it is. `person` REQUIRES `by`: the allowance is per side, so a named player with no side is credited on the leaderboard while nothing charges the break to anyone, and the ITF limit is per player. The fold cannot derive the side (it holds the two entrant ids and no lineup), so it refuses instead. |
| A break allowance, and a break that runs over it | configurable | entrant | `Cfg.interruptions[kind].count` / `.seconds` → `State.interruptions[].overCount` / `.overran` | extended | BOTH are **recorded and flagged, never rejected** — the (N+1)th break of a kind by one side in one set gets `overCount`, an over-long one gets `overran`, and both stand. Nothing derived from cfg may throw: cfg is read live from `division.config` and every read replays the whole stream from `init`, so a refusal computed here fires on events already in the ledger the moment an organiser lowers the number, with no event to void and no scorer action that recovers the fixture. (§5.4 specified a hard refusal for `count`; the W4a review corrected it — the period kernel takes the same decision for `periodSeconds`, in the same words.) `count` is evaluated only where the break names a side: a rain delay is charged to nobody, the same conditional shape ITTF expedite takes without `serving`. Both flags are PROJECTIONS of the cfg in force at read time, not facts about the event, and a later cfg edit legitimately flips them against an unchanged `duration` — the alternative freezes a verdict beside the input it came from, which is the two-fields-that-silently-disagree bug this wave rejected everywhere else. No shipped variant declares an allowance. |
| **When** a break was called | all | — | `Ev.Interruption.at` (`GameTime` verbatim), `playPhases(cfg)` = `pre, S1…S{bestOf}` | extended | the period is the **set** and `elapsed` counts from the start of that set, which is how the card and every broadcast clock report tennis time — the generator's stamp is set-relative for the same reason, so the corpus freezes the model the row states. Optional: an unstamped break is unconstrained by the kernel's monotonic guard, so no recorded stream changed meaning. A stamp naming a set the match has not reached is refused; the set on the record is always the fold's own index, never the payload's. `apply()` re-validates both the stamp's period and its own set index against `playPhases(cfg)` before comparing them, so a period the sport does not declare is a fixable `INVALID_EVENT` — `apply` is reached directly by conformance and simulation, where the kernel's check never runs, and `UNKNOWN_PHASE` there is an unactionable 500. |
| Coaching (now permitted on tour) | all | person | — | deferred | not a scoring fact; when it is illegal it arrives as a code violation, which is modelled above. |
| Retirement | all | entrant | `core.forfeit` → `outcome.kind = "award"` | modelled | completed sets already stand in the ledger. |
| Walkover | all | entrant | `core.forfeit` before `core.start` | modelled | same event, no sets played. |
| Suspension for rain or darkness | all | — | `core.suspend` / `core.resume` (both carry `at`) for a stoppage play returns from; `core.abandon` → `State.replayFlagged` when it does not | modelled | kernel-owned, so no tennis code folds them. The suspend/resume pair and `tennis.interruption` are complementary records and a chair may write both: the pair says play stopped and when, the interruption says which break it was and who it is charged to. |
| Singles vs doubles | all | entrant kind | `entrantModel.kinds` (`individual`, `pair`) | modelled | entrant kind, not a module variant. |
| Doubles serving and receiving order | all | persons | `LineupSlot.pairOrder` → `State.squads.<side>.members[].pairOrder`, read by `expectedDoublesServer(state, side, serviceTurn)` (nested kernel) | extended | S3/W4b (#426). The lineup-layer fact the row was waiting on now exists and, unlike `orderNo` (team-sheet order across the whole squad — a team tie has several first-named players), it says which partner of THIS pair was named first. It survives `init` into State: the snapshot is written at init precisely when the sheet declares something the pre-wave lineup model had no home for, and `pairOrder` is one of the two such facts. `expectedDoublesServer` is the reader the rotation check needs — it answers the side's `serviceTurn`-th service game BY PERSON ID, and the caller compares that with the `server` the ledger recorded. `null` for singles or an undeclared order, never a guess. Enforcement stays a validation the caller performs, not a fold-time refusal: a chair who mis-keys a server has recorded a fact, and refusing it would make the fixture unfoldable rather than merely wrong. |
| Chair umpire on the card | all | official | `officialLabel.scorer = "Chair Umpire"` | modelled | |
| Remarks | all | — | `core.note` | modelled | free text, no fold effect. |
| A printed tennis scorecard | all | — | — | deferred | only volleyball ships an `exportTemplates.scoresheet`; a tennis card is a print task for a later wave, not a schema gap. |

| Where in the match an event happened (the position axis) | all | — | `SportModule.position(state)` -> `set` + `game` + `points` segments, e.g. `Set 2 . Game 4 . 30-15` | extended | W4a T6b. A **read-side projection**, never a payload: a `MatchPosition` on every stamped event was considered this wave and rejected, because position is derivable from state the fold already computes and recording it would create a recorded value and a derived value of the same type that can silently disagree — the `DisciplineCard.entrantSide` shape. A wrong recorded value is in the hash-chained ledger forever; a wrong projection is one deploy away from fixed. Ordered segments rather than a display string, so W8 can drop a segment for a 375px scorebug, localise each `key` and order two positions in one match; `formatPosition` is the plain-text path. Nothing is materialised into state, so every frozen golden is byte-identical. The tie-break needs no special case: `State.games` is held at 6-6 through it, so it falls out as game 13 of the set. A MATCH tie-break replaces the final set and has no games, so the game segment is omitted rather than reported as a phantom `Game 1`. The point score deliberately carries NO ordinal — points played is not derivable from `GamePoints` past deuce, so `comparePosition` is told to stop at the game rather than handed an invented rank it would sort by. Once a set banks the kernel resets `games` and `points`, so a decided match reads its games off the set that was actually played and drops the points segment. |

**Row counts:** 24 modelled, 12 extended, 7 deferred (43 rows).

## Downstream owed

- **Position labels owed in all four locale dictionaries** (W4a T6b): `scoring.position.set`, `scoring.position.game`.
  `SportModule.position` returns a stable segment `key` plus an ENGLISH `label`
  fallback — the engine writes no locale copy, by the same rule `MetricSpec.label`
  follows. W8 renders `scoring.position.<key>` and falls back to `label`. The `period`, `clock` and `points` segments carry NO label — `P2`, `12:41` and `30–15` name themselves, and labelling them renders "Period P2".
  Deliberately NOT written by this task, which touches no dictionary.

- **New event type** `tennis.sanction`, reachable at fidelity tiers 2 and 3
  under the existing `scoring.rally_by_rally` entitlement. No new FeatureKey was
  introduced.
- **New enum** `NestedSanctionLevel` = `warning | point_penalty | game_penalty |
  default`. `apps/web/src/lib/scoring-vocab.ts` humanises unknown values, so
  nothing breaks, but a label set is owed — and `default` in particular reads
  badly unlabelled.
- **`tennis.sanction.reason`** (W4 review) — optional free text, the chair's own
  words for the offence. It reaches `DisciplineCard.reason` and nothing else:
  the fold never reads it, so no recorded state and no golden moves. A pad
  should offer it as a free-text field beside the ladder step, not as a picker,
  until the taxonomy row above is resolved.
- **New payload fields** `tennis.point.server` and `.scorer`. A doubles pad must
  offer both members of each pair, and should default `server` from
  `summary.detail.serving` plus the pair's order.
- **`summary().detail`** now carries `persons` and `sanctions` when non-empty.
  Tennis can afford `persons` in the summary because it declares no `coarsen`
  hook — the set-based kernel deliberately cannot (see `DOMAIN.volleyball.md`).
- **`playerStats` now exists** (`points`, `service_points`, `aces`,
  `double_faults`, `violations`, `medical_timeouts`), so tennis leaderboards
  stop reporting `requires_detailed_scoring`. A later wave can still derive
  first-serve-free serving stats from `aces` / `double_faults` over
  `service_points`. `medical_timeouts` counts MEDICAL breaks only — a toilet
  break or a rain delay is not a statistic about a player, and one shared key
  would make the number mean nothing on a leaderboard.
- **S8/#417 (W6) shipped the entrant-fallback + folded row above**:
  `points_won`, `matches`, `sets_won`, `sets_lost`, `games_won` are now a
  KERNEL default, merged with the six metrics already listed here
  (preset-declared keys win on any collision — none exist today, the two
  sets are disjoint by construction). A stream that never named
  `server`/`scorer` at all — the v1-era case — now still produces person
  rows, as long as a `PlayerStatsFoldCtx` is supplied.
- **New event type** `tennis.interruption` (W4a #425 §5.4), reachable at
  fidelity tiers 2 and 3 under the existing `scoring.rally_by_rally`
  entitlement. No new FeatureKey. There is deliberately **no end event**: a
  start/end pair would make `duration` derivable from the end's stamp, and this
  wave's rule is that `at` records only what the fold cannot derive.
- **New enum** `NestedInterruptionKind` = `medical | toilet | heat | other`, and
  a new `overran` flag on the record. Label keys are owed in
  `apps/web/src/lib/scoring-vocab.ts` and all four dictionaries (#427):
  the event name, the four kinds, `overran`, and a heading for the
  `summary.detail.interruptions` block. `other` in particular reads badly
  unlabelled.
- **New cfg** `Cfg.interruptions[kind] = { count?, seconds? }` — optional with no
  default, so no shipped variant declares one and no frozen state string moves.
  A rules editor offering it must say which scope each half has: `count` is per
  side per SET, `seconds` is per break.
- **`playPhases(cfg)`** is now declared by the tennis module — `pre` then `S1…
  S{bestOf}`. Two consequences beyond this event: a stamped `core.suspend` /
  `core.resume` on a tennis fixture must name one of those periods or it is
  refused as `INVALID_EVENT`, and stamps are now ordered by the kernel's
  monotonic guard. A pad must submit stamps in non-decreasing order or handle
  `NON_MONOTONIC_TIME`; correcting one is void **then** re-append (W4a §4.1).
- **`summary().detail`** gains `interruptions` when non-empty, alongside
  `persons` and `sanctions`.
- **New event type** `tennis.game.award` (S5, #431) resolves the one
  substantive fact this dossier used to flag as still needing a product
  decision: the game a **game penalty** concedes now has a representation,
  mirroring the point-penalty pattern one level up —
  `tennis.sanction{level:"game_penalty"}` stays an unchanged, score-neutral
  record (`applySanction` untouched; the existing frozen corpora's
  `game_penalty` sanctions still fold exactly as they always did) and this new
  event carries the actual scoring consequence, entered alongside it. It calls
  the existing `winGame` directly — no new fold logic, no new `State` field —
  and refuses (`GAME_AWARD_DURING_TIEBREAK`) mid-tie-break and
  mid-match-tie-break: the breaker itself IS the deciding game, so conceding a
  SET there would be a genuinely different, undesigned cascade, deliberately
  out of scope this session. Reachable at fidelity tiers 2 and 3 under the
  existing `scoring.rally_by_rally` entitlement; no new FeatureKey. See
  `_INDEX.md`'s 2026-08-11 S5/#431 decision-log entry for the ruling context.
  The medical-timeout gap that used to sit beside this one is closed above —
  the engine still owns no clock, and does not need one: the chair's stamp and
  the break's length both arrive as recorded values.
