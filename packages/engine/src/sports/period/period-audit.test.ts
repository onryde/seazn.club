// W4 Layer-1 audit — the period family's additive extensions (#407 programme).
//
// Every test here pins a fact the FIH / IIHF scoresheet records that the
// kernel could not represent before this wave: per-goal attribution (scorer,
// assists, clock, empty net), the infraction and the serving player behind a
// suspension, the shoot-out taker and the goalkeeper facing him, and the
// awarded-vs-converted set piece (FIH penalty corner / penalty stroke, IIHF
// penalty shot).
//
// The additive contract is asserted here too: a payload that carries none of
// the new fields must leave state byte-identical to the pre-W4 shape, which is
// what keeps hockey.golden.json / icehockey.golden.json replaying green.
