 *    that leaves the team full has no wrong strength chip to prevent and keeps

/**
 * `goals_conceded` and `clean_sheets`, shared by both period-kernel sports —
 * see each of `hockey/DOMAIN.md` and `icehockey/DOMAIN.md`'s "Goalkeeper
 * stats" row. Parameterised on the sport's own goal event type
 * (`"hockey.goal"` / `"icehockey.goal"`) and `PeriodPreset.keeperGroup`
 * ("GK" FIH, "G" IIHF); everything else about the mechanism is identical
 * for both codes, so it lives here once rather than being copied into
 * `hockey.ts` and `icehockey.ts` separately — "a change gated for one must
 * not silently alter the other" is easiest to keep true when there is only
 * one implementation to keep true of.
 *
 * READS THE FOLD OF `core.lineup.*` EVENTS, never the kickoff team sheet —
 * a mid-match keeper change (a substitution, a `core.lineup.position`
 * change of gloves, a pulled/returning goalie) must split both metrics
 * between the two people who actually held the position. Reconstructs
 * squads itself, from `initSquads(lineups)` forward, under
 * `REPLAY_LINEUP_POLICY` (every knob at its most permissive) — this is a
 * read-side replay with no `cfg` to consult even if it wanted one, and a
 * refused/malformed lineup event is simply a no-op here, exactly as
 * `reduceLineupEvent` documents for any other replay reader.
 *
 * `goals_conceded` is charged to the CONCEDING side's current keeper,
 * worked out from the CREDITED side (`opponent(credited)`), never from
 * `by` directly — an own goal (`kind: "og"`) is credited to `opponent(by)`,
 * so the two disagree exactly there, and it is `by`'s own keeper who
 * actually concedes it. `emptyNet` goals charge nobody (no keeper is on
 * the ice to blame) but still break the conceding side's clean sheet,
 * because the TEAM conceded regardless of whether anyone is nameable for
 * it.
 *
 * A shoot-out is invisible to this fold BY CONSTRUCTION, not by a special
 * case: `*.shootout.attempt` is a different event type than `goalType` and
 * is simply never matched — the same reason the GWS +1 (`officialScore`)
 * never reaches `goals_conceded` either. IIHF Rule 87 / NHL 84.4 and the
 * FIH App 12 shoot-out both produce no player goal and no goal against,
 * only the deciding kick.
 *
 * CLEAN SHEET RULE (a documented judgement call, S8/#417 — no rulebook
 * settles this): a goalkeeper SPELL is the continuous stretch one person
 * occupies `keeperGroup` for their side — opened at kickoff (or wherever
 * the fold first finds an occupant) and closed by the next lineup change
 * that installs a DIFFERENT occupant (or none), or by the end of the
 * recorded stream. A spell earns ONE clean sheet iff no goal was credited
 * against that side at any point during it. A mid-match change therefore
 * SPLITS a shutout: if keeper A concedes nothing before being substituted
 * for keeper B, who also concedes nothing for the rest of the match, BOTH
 * earn a clean sheet — the team kept a clean sheet during each of their
 * watches, the same intuition "clean sheet" already carries per-appearance
 * rather than per-fixture in most scorebooks. This reads only recorded
 * lineup events and goal credits, so it carries none of the S2/#430
 * partial-coverage hazard a MINUTES-based rule would: a scorer who never
 * records elapsed time cannot leave this particular denominator
 * half-known, because nothing here is a function of minutes at all.
 *
 * S8/#417 W6 — `saves`, `shots_faced` and `save_percentage`, fed by
 * `shotType` (`"hockey.shot"` / `"icehockey.shot"`, optional — a sport whose
 * preset has `shotTracking` unset never emits it, and `undefined` here just
 * means the branch below never matches anything). `shots_faced` is
 * `saves + goals_conceded`, NOT a count of outcome-"scored" shot events — a
 * goal is already fully known from `goalType` above, so `shots_faced` needs
 * no redundant shot logged alongside every goal to be complete; only
 * "saved" shots add anything new. A shot with outcome "scored" NEVER bumps
 * `goals_conceded` or `shots_faced` here — that would double-charge the same
 * real-world goal the `goalType` branch already counted, exactly the hazard
 * this session's brief calls out by name; it is read for coverage evidence
 * only (see below). "missed"/"blocked" shots never reached the keeper at
 * all and touch nothing. The credited keeper is `PeriodShot.goalkeeper` when
 * present, else the same spell-derived on-ice occupant `goals_conceded`
 * already uses — explicit beats derived, mirroring S8's own resolution
 * order.
 *
 * SAVE PERCENTAGE'S COVERAGE MECHANISM (owner ruling, S2/#430, restated for
 * shots): a scorer may record some shots and not others, and a save
 * percentage computed from a half-recorded shot stream is worse than none —
 * so it is a **coverage checksum, evaluated per SIDE**: a side is trusted
 * iff every goal it conceded (`goalType`, always complete — the match result
 * depends on it) also has a matching outcome-"scored" shot logged against
 * it (`shotType`). Per SIDE, not per person or per spell, because it is the
 * scorer's own decision to track a side's shots comprehensively across the
 * match, not a fact about one individual keeper's stretch in goal. This is
 * the strongest signal answerable from inside the ledger alone — a scorer
 * diligent enough to double-log every goal as a shot too is, by the same
 * diligence, the one most likely to have logged every save — not an
 * absolute guarantee: **known limitation** — a side that conceded NOTHING
 * has no goal to check a shot log against and is trusted by default, so a
 * shutout side's saves could in principle be under-logged with no way for
 * this checksum to catch it. Accepted rather than solved: no signal inside
 * a raw event ledger can distinguish "diligently tracked, genuinely zero
 * missed saves" from "a few saves logged, several more never were" when
 * there is no goal to cross-check against, and this repo prefers an honest,
 * provable-from-data checksum over a heuristic that only LOOKS more
 * complete. `shots_faced === 0` also omits the key — nothing to divide by,
 * the same "absent, not a false zero" discipline every other silent-0 fix
 * in this programme already follows.

   * 3. `cfg.overtime.skaters` is DECLARED. Only the sudden-death branch carries
   *    it, and it has no default: without a number there is nothing to be
   *    side-relative about, so the base/min rule stands. The flag cannot invent
