 * SIDE-RELATIVE:
 *
 *     strength(X) = skaters + max(0, short(opponent) − short(X))
 *
 * The `max(0, …)` is what makes coincidental penalties cancel — one each is
 * played 3-on-3, not 4-on-4, which is where a flat "gain one per opponent
 * penalty" reading goes wrong. Two against one is likewise 4-on-3, not 5-on-4.
 *
 * Why NOT a base swap, since that is the obvious move and it is destructive:
 * ice hockey declares `strength {base: 5, min: 3}` against `overtime.skaters:
 * 3`, and `strengthOf` floors at `min`, so swapping the base makes base === min,
 * both sides sit at base for any number of penalties, `strengthChip` returns
 * null and the power-play chip DISAPPEARS in overtime — strictly less than the
 * `5v4` it printed before. Field hockey's `fih-detail` config collides
 * identically (`skaters: 7` against `min: 7`).
 *
 * CAPPED AT FULL STRENGTH. Rule 84.4 never puts more than five skaters against
 * three: a third penalty against the same side is served consecutively rather
 * than stacking a further on-ice advantage, so the beneficiary stops gaining at
 * `base`. Without the cap the engine renders `6v3`, a strength no rulebook
 * allows.
 *
 * The cap is `base` and the floor on the offending side is `skaters`, and the
 * two come from OPPOSITE ENDS of the same cfg pair — `strength.base` is full
 * strength, `overtime.skaters` is the overtime complement. Neither is
 * simplifiable into the other: the offender is pinned at `skaters` by
 * construction (its `max(0, …)` term is zero), the beneficiary is bounded by
 * `base`, and `strength.min` plays no part here at all because nobody is ever
 * reduced. Do not collapse them.
