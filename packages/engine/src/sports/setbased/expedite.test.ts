// W4a (#425) §5.3 — the ITTF expedite system on the set-based kernel.
//
// Law 2.15 in three parts, and each one is a test below:
//   2.15.1  expedite is introduced when a game reaches 10 minutes unfinished
//           (or earlier by agreement), unless both players have reached 9.
//           The TEN-MINUTE TRIGGER IS THE PAD'S — the engine only records that
//           it fired, as `<key>.expedite.start`.
//   2.15.2  under expedite the RECEIVER wins the point if they make 13 good
//           returns. `returns` counts the RECEIVER'S good returns, not the
//           rally's stroke count.
//   2.15.4  once introduced, expedite runs to the end of the MATCH. A new game
//           does not clear it — the single fact most implementations get wrong.
//
// Enforcement is CONDITIONAL, and deliberately so: the set-based kernel holds
// no serving state (`payload.server` is a PERSON feeding a `serves` tally), so
// the receiver can only be named when the rally itself carries `serving`.
// Where it does not, the rally is counted unenforceable and stands.
