// parallel exemption list, `UNREACHABLE_FIELDS`, for the fields that ride on
// a branch a given sport can never reach — e.g. `badminton.timeout`'s
// `technical`). `padSpecConformanceSuite`'s bijection check (a) is therefore
// against the FULL union, not the sport's own recordable subset: narrowing
// `eventSchemas` to "only what THIS preset records" would break bijection
// for every sport on this kernel, every time, structurally — the fix would
// have to narrow `eventSchema` itself, which is out of scope this session
// (it feeds `schema-snapshot.ts` and `golden.ts`'s optional-field walk, and
// nothing recorded ever needed the wider shape narrowed).
//
// The CONSEQUENCE for padSpec: a branch this preset's `records` says it
// cannot record (e.g. `badminton.timeout`, `volleyball.expedite.start`,
// `tabletennis.sub`) is registered in `eventSchemas` (bijection needs it) but
// gets NO action, ever, for ANY cfg of that sport — permanently, not merely
// for the cfg under test. This is NOT the cfg-mutual-exclusivity case
// `checkActionCoverage`'s own doc comment describes (cricket's superOver vs
// 2-innings, where EVERY branch is reachable from SOME legal cfg): here a
// branch is unreachable from ALL of a sport's cfgs. `checkActionCoverage` is
// therefore called (setbased/padspec.test.ts) only for volleyball, where
// indoor/beach genuinely disagree on `substitutions` — the real
// mutual-exclusivity case — and explicitly NOT for badminton/tabletennis,

 * W4a (#425) T6b — "Set 3 · 21–19". Module scope, so badminton, table tennis
 * and volleyball hold the SAME reference; `position.conformance.test.ts`
 * asserts that by identity, the way `phases.test.ts` asserts `playPhases`.
 *
 * THE SET NUMBER IS THE COMPLETED COUNT THROUGH `currentUnit`, not
 * `state.sets.length`. `sets` holds the closed sets AND a trailing open one, so
 * the two agree while a set is in progress and disagree in the two places that
 * matter: between sets, where `sets.length` under-counts by one, and after the
 * match is decided, where `closed + 1` names a set nobody played.
 *
 * The score comes from `sets[n - 1]` — the set this resolved to — which makes
 * every case fall out of one expression: love-all before the first rally, the
 * live score during a set, love-all again between sets, and the final score of
 * the deciding set once the match is over.
 *
 * `home + away` is an exact rank here in a way it is not in tennis: every rally
 * scores a point, so it counts rallies played and orders two positions inside
 * one set.
