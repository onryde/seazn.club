 * first stamped event of the second half sweeps a bin that still has 500
 * seconds to run — under-serving the player, silently, in the offending side's
 * favour. `addDuration` itself is unchanged: it is a primitive over one period
 * and never rolls forward; the carry lives here, walking `clockPhases`.
 *
 * The nominal length is what cfg holds, so a half that actually ran 48 minutes
 * still carries against 45. Stated rather than hidden, and the same
 * approximation the period kernel makes.
 *

 *  - **The cap** (Law 3). Never applied under `rollingSubs`, which is uncapped

 *  - **Growth** (ruling 1) is OFF, and football loses nothing by it: every
 *    football substitute comes off a pre-named bench, so a lineup event naming
 *    a person the team sheet never had is a mistake, not a concussion call-up.
 *  - **Exemptions** are declared, never inferred: the IFAB concussion trial and
