   * and label events by, projected from state at read time.
   *
   * READ-SIDE BY RULING. The alternative — a `MatchPosition` on every stamped
   * payload — was considered and rejected this wave: `at` is recorded because
   * the fold cannot derive elapsed time, and position IS derivable, so
   * recording it creates a recorded-vs-derived pair of the same type that can
   * silently disagree (the `DisciplineCard.entrantSide` shape). Full argument
   * in `core/position.ts`.
   *
   * OPTIONAL, and its absence is not a gap to be filled. All eleven modules
   * stay at `1.0.0` and `registry.get(key, version)` is an exact lookup with no
   * fallback, so this could never have been required. But the option is also
   * the honest answer for a sport with no position: boardgame's IS the move
   * index, which `BoardgameResult.moves` already carries on the single terminal
   * event, and generic has a running score and no cursor at all. Absent ⇒ the
   * caller orders and labels by `seq` — decided ONCE, in `matchPositionOf`.
   *
   * MUST NOT be materialised into `State`. cfg and state are serialised into
   * the frozen golden strings; a position field in `init` would break all
   * eleven corpora at once, and would be the very denormalisation above.
   *
   * Defined at every prefix, like `summary` (§9.5): at `init`, mid-match, and
   * after the match is decided — where it names the last unit ACTUALLY PLAYED
   * (`currentUnit`), never a phantom next one.
