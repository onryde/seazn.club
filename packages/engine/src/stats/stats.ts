/**
 * Resolve a payload path — a plain dotted walk through objects, so a metric can
 * name a nested credit (`"runs.bat"` for the striker, `"wicket.fielder"` for
 * the catcher). Deliberately NOT a query language: no array indexing, no
 * wildcards, no predicates.
 *
 * Three rules make it safe against real scoring payloads:
 *
 * 1. **A path that does not resolve returns `undefined`, never a throw.**
 *    Payloads are heterogeneous by design — `wicket` is absent on every ball
 *    that is not a dismissal — so a missing path is the normal case, not an
 *    error. Walking through `undefined`, `null` or a scalar all land here.
 * 2. **A literal key wins over the walk**, at every step. That is what keeps
 *    every pre-existing single-segment lookup (`"scorer"`, `"person"`) byte-for
 *    -byte identical, and it also makes a payload key that genuinely contains a
 *    dot reachable rather than shadowed.
 * 3. **Arrays are a leaf, not a step.** A resolved array still credits every
 *    person in it (ice hockey's two assists — see below), but a path may not
 *    index into one. An empty segment resolves to nothing rather than to the
 *    object it was written on, so a typo can never credit a whole record.
