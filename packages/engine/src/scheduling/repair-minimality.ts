// The minimality CERTIFICATE for a decomposed repair (#401).
//
// A decomposed repair solves one component with the rest of the board frozen, so
// its `k` is an UPPER BOUND by construction: restricting which fixtures may move
// can only raise the number of moves, never lower it. The ascending-k search
// inside one component proves that component minimal against a frozen board and
// nothing more. Reporting that as "minimal" would be a claim the search does not
// support — and minimal movement is a SAFETY property here, not a nicety: a
// repair that moves more cards than it had to has told entrants the wrong time.
//
// So minimality is proved the other way round, by a LOWER bound that meets it.
//
//   Take a set of conflicts on the ORIGINAL board whose fixtures do not overlap.
//   Each one can only be resolved by moving a fixture it names — a court clash
//   between two cards is a function of exactly those two placements, and nothing
//   else on the board changes it. Because the sets are disjoint, no single move
//   can serve two of them. So any repair must move at least one fixture per
//   conflict in the set: `k >= |set|`.
//
// When the found `k` equals that bound it IS the global minimum, decomposition
// or no decomposition, and the certificate says `proved`. When it does not, the
// answer is reported as an upper bound and the caller is told why.
//
// WHICH FIXTURES A CONFLICT NAMES is the one thing this file must not guess. A
// `court` row carries its counterparty in its details; a `rest` row does not;
// a per-day cap row names one card out of a whole day. Rather than parse
// strings or re-derive the rule, every witness is obtained FROM THE VERIFIER:
// run `validateAssignments` on the fixture alone, then on the fixture plus one
// neighbour, and attribute by `conflictKey`. A conflict no sub-board reproduces
// — the per-day cap, whose details carry the whole day's total — is left
// UNATTRIBUTED and simply does not enter the bound. That is the safe direction:
// fewer certified conflicts is a weaker lower bound, never a wrong one.
