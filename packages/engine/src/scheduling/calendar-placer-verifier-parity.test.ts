// #463 — THE test this wave exists for. A test that asserts only the placer's
// behaviour cannot catch a fork; this one feeds the placer's OWN OUTPUT back to
// `validateAssignments` per rule family, so any family the placer stops
// honouring fails here rather than shipping as "Auto proposes a board the apply
// gate warns about, and re-running Auto proposes the same board again".
//
// Every typed-rule breach reports `reason: "instruction"` (rule code H8) — there
// is no per-family field on `Conflict` — and each case below puts exactly one
// family in force, so an `instruction` row can only have come from it.
//
// Each config is sized so the rule BITES: without the placer honouring it the
// board really does breach, which is what a parity assertion needs to be worth
// running. Proven by reverting calendar.ts to the pre-#463 placer, where every
// case here fails.
