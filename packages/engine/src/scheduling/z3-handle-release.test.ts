// Every WASM handle this package takes out is handed back.
//
// THIS IS A SOURCE SCAN, and it is one deliberately. A leaked `Z3_model` is
// invisible from every value the solvers return: the board, the metrics, the
// status and `rlimitSpent` are all identical either way, and the damage arrives
// later and somewhere else — `rlimitCount`'s own comment in `build.ts` records
// a leaked `Z3_stats` corrupting the heap and aborting a probe inside
// `smt::relevancy_propagator_imp::pop`, at the next `solver.pop()` rather than
// anywhere near the leak. There is no behavioural assertion to write, so the
// alternative to this file is no coverage at all.
//
// `ModelImpl` and `StatisticsImpl` share one FinalizationRegistry, so the model
// handles here are the same class of object at a comparable rate: one per `sat`
// verdict, across four tier walks and every LNS sub-solve.
//
// MUTATION-VERIFIED: deleting `m.release()` from `withModel` reds the first
// case; deleting `model.release()` from `repair.ts` reds the second.
