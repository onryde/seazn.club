// The pin builder may only pin cards THIS RUN OWNS.
//
// `solveBuild` builds its pin list from `locked` fixtures plus `frozen` ids, and
// resolves a frozen id through `publishedSlotOf` — which falls back to the
// caller's `current` board. That lookup never asked whether the id names a
// fixture in this run at all, while the force loop a hundred lines further down
// already did (`fixtures.findIndex(...) < 0 -> continue`). The two disagreed,
// and the disagreement is not inert: every pin is admitted into the lattice
// UNCONDITIONALLY, court filter included, so a stale id sitting on a court the
// organiser never configured hands the solver a free slot there.
//
// Reviewer ran it: `courts: ["C1"]`, a ghost pin on `C9`, and fixture `b` came
// back placed on C9 with `status: "ok"`, `engine: "z3"`, `tiersCompleted: 4`.
//
// Latent today — the single web caller derives `frozen` from the same list
// `schedulable` comes from, so the two sets cannot diverge there — which is
// exactly why it needs a test: nothing else covers it.
