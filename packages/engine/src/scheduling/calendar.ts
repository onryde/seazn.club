/**
 * Round order (H6) ALONE — same-SEQUENCE pairs with round_i < round_j and at
 * least one movable side: day_i <= day_j (unconditional) and, when they land
 * on the same day, start_i <= start_j (ties legal — the pair set is all
 * r < r', never r <= r'). Reported as `reason: "order", direct: true` — the
 * SAME family feed-order violations use (RULE_BY_REASON maps it to H6, and
 * the AI prompt's own H6 text already says "Rounds generally flow in order;
 * never schedule a final before its semifinals finish" — round order is that
 * same statement, just derived from a round NUMBER instead of a winner/loser
 * edge). Blamed on the LATER round (`b`, the side with a "must not start
 * before" obligation), matching how feed-order blames the dependent fixture
 * rather than the feeder.
 *
 * "Same sequence" is (divisionId, stageId, poolId), NOT divisionId alone —
 * found during implementation, not named in the spec's literal
 * "same-division" text: a `kind: "group"` stage with N pools runs N
 * INDEPENDENT round-robin sequences, each restarting at round 1 (`stages.ts`'s
 * `generate()` calls `roundRobinGen` once per pool). Two pools sharing one
 * division but each on their own round 2 are not comparable, the same way two
 * stages are not — omitting `poolId` from the key compared Pool A's round 3
 * against Pool B's round 1 as if they were one sequence, on the ordinary,
 * common shape of a pooled group stage (proven wrong by `schedule.test.ts`'s
 * "8-team group+KO division", the very first end-to-end reflow scenario this
 * design was checked against). A division with no pools (`poolId` undefined
 * on every row) collapses to one group, unchanged from dividing by
 * `divisionId` alone.
 *
 * `stageId` joined the key later (C1 fix-loop, Finding 2): a division can
 * carry MORE than one round-robin-kind stage — two `league` stages, or a
 * `league` beside an unpooled `group` — and none of them is required to have
 * a pool. `poolId` alone cannot separate two such stages: both read
 * `undefined`, so `(divisionId, poolId)` collapsed them into one sequence
 * exactly the way bare `divisionId` once collapsed two pools into one.
 * `stageId` is the dimension that was still missing.
 *
 * Scoped to `assignments` only, not `existing` — this function takes no
 * `existing` parameter at all, structurally, because round order has never
 * needed one: every caller that folds this run's own pins into the board
 * being verified does so INTO `assignments` (see `apps/web`'s `settle`/
 * `full` — "the pinned cards rejoin the proposal here"), so a pin-movable
 * pair for THIS run's division is already covered without reaching into
 * `existing`, which is cross-division/cross-stage context where a SECOND,
 * independently 1-based round-robin sequence could otherwise silently
 * collide with this one (design doc's stage-scoping ruling — `build.ts` owns
 * the wire-side defensive guard for that case, and for the pooled case,
 * since the wire has no pool index at all — see `build.ts`'s own comment on
 * the mixed-sequence guard).
 *
 * Absent `tz` skips the whole family, same convention `slotFixtures`' typed-
 * rule block already uses: a calendar day cannot be derived without one, and
 * reporting a violation the organiser never expressed (bucketed in UTC) is
 * worse than reporting none. `dayKeyInTz` is the ONE shared day-derivation
 * helper both TS sides already import — no second copy.
 *
 * EXPORTED, standalone (C1 fix-loop): the delta gate's checked-set widening
 * (`moveFixture`/`applySchedule`'s partial-apply path, joint multi-division
 * apply) exists ONLY so this pairwise scan can see a moved fixture's
 * already-placed round-robin siblings — those two seams pull siblings out of
 * `existing` into the checked set specifically so THIS function's grouping
 * sees them, symmetrically on both sides of their delta compare. Folding that
 * widened set into the ordinary `validateAssignments` call, as the original
 * fix did, meant every OTHER rule family (rest/court/person/window) ALSO
 * started evaluating pairwise among those siblings — they had always been
 * fixed CONTEXT before, visible only via `existing`, never focal. Calling
 * THIS function separately on the widened set, and merging only its `"order"`
 * conflicts into the result, gets round order the visibility it needs
 * without moving one sibling out of `existing` for anyone else.
