// The large-neighbourhood fallback.
//
// Two layers, deliberately. The window PLAN and the acceptance rule are pure
// decisions and are tested against an INJECTED `solveWindow` — that is the only
// way to assert what the window solve was actually ASKED (a frozen card pinned
// rather than merely un-chosen, the rest of the board pinned rather than passed
// as `existing`, an unplaced fixture offered a slot), none of which is visible
// from the returned board. A stub that never moves anything passes every
// output-only assertion, which is why the plan's own sketches are not used.
//
// The last two cases then run the REAL build solver as `solveWindow`, because a
// plan that is never handed to z3 proves nothing about the feature.
//
// TWO MEASURED FACTS the plan was written against, recorded so nobody
// re-derives them:
//
//   * `repairSchedule` cannot drive this. It minimises MOVES to reach legality
//     and short-circuits on a legal board before it loads the WASM
//     (`repair.ts:266-278`), and every board this pass is handed is already
//     legal. The three-card corner below comes back `status: "clean"`,
//     `checks: 0`, makespan 90 in and 90 out.
//   * the out-of-window rows cannot be passed as `existing`. Measured: freeze
//     `a` at 09:00, hand `b` and `c` to a window with `a` as `existing`, and
//     the sub-solve answers `b@C2+180, c@C1+180` — window makespan 30, board
//     makespan 210 against the 90 it started at. `existing` constrains the
//     model and is invisible to the objective.
