 * crossed a DST boundary. Verified by sweeping all 418 zones
 * `Intl.supportedValuesOf("timeZone")` reports over 400 consecutive days: a

 * zone-dependent and NOT necessarily the nearest real instant: asking for
 * 02:30 on a US spring-forward date yields 01:30 local, an hour BEFORE the
 * time requested. Every caller here asks for a day boundary or a session hour,
 * neither of which lands in a gap except on the handful of zones that shift at
 * midnight, so the residue is a rounding of the day's edge, never a placement.
 *
 * An ambiguous local time — the fall-back hour, which happens twice — resolves
 * to the FIRST occurrence, which is the right reading for a day start.
