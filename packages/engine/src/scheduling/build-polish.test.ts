// POLISH, and what `already_optimal` is actually a claim about.
//
// THE BRIEF FOR THIS FILE HAD A FALSE PREMISE, and it is recorded here because
// the correction is the whole content of the file. Task 7 was written as "add
// the `already_optimal` status to `build.ts`", with the two acceptance cases
// below as its failing step. They were run FIRST, against an untouched
// `build.ts`, and both passed: the status shipped with Task 5. Nothing was added
// to `build.ts` for this file.
//
// What the brief would have CHANGED is the predicate, and that is the part worth
// guarding. It proposed:
//
//     input.mode === "polish" && moved === 0  ->  "already_optimal"
//
// and `build.ts` instead keys on `tiersCompleted === TIER_COUNT && !improved`.
// Those are not two spellings of one rule. `already_optimal` is a PROOF — every
// tier ran to a verdict and none could better the board — and the proposed
// predicate proves nothing on either side:
//
//   * it FIRES on a run that never got a verdict. A POLISH run whose budget
//     died before the first check also moved nothing, so it would be reported
//     as optimal on the strength of having done no work at all. Measured
//     below: `rlimit: 1` gives `tiersCompleted: 0`, `budgetExpired: true`.
//   * it goes SILENT for BUILD. A proven-optimal board with no `mode` would
//     drop back to `ok`, which is the existing behaviour it would regress.
//
// Both directions are pinned below, so the predicate cannot be quietly loosened
// into the brief's version later.
//
// R19 POSTSCRIPT: `BuildInput.mode` has since been DELETED. It was never read —
// the calls below passed it and this file's own assertions were the proof that
// nothing keyed on it — so what makes a run POLISH is `frozen`/`current`, and
// nothing else. The predicate above is therefore not merely unused but
// unspellable, which is the strongest form of the guard this file was written
// to provide.
