// The placer must avoid a person double-booking whatever `crossPersonClash`
// says, because the WRITE GATE already refuses one whatever it says.
//
// `assertNoNewBlocking` (apps/web schedule.ts) filters the delta through
// `isBlockingConflict`, which lists `person_overlap` unconditionally — #399
// retired the setting as the switch, and `competition-schedule-apply.test.ts`
// pins that with a clean A/B ("refuses an INTRODUCED person double-booking
// whatever crossPersonClash says").
//
// The gap is narrower than it first looks, and the two cases are worth keeping
// straight:
//
//   draft vs draft      already safe. #463 widened `lastEnd` to namespaced
//                       `person:` keys, so two movable cards sharing a person
//                       serialise through the REST path even at `restF = 0`.
//                       Guarded below so a narrowing of `restKeysOf` is caught.
//   draft vs `existing`  NOT safe. `input.existing` seeds `bookings` and
//                       `dayCounts` and never `lastEnd`, so the rest path is
//                       blind to a person already committed on a sibling
//                       division's fixed board. `personBlocked` was the only
//                       guard, and it was gated on `crossPersonClash === "hard"`.
//
// That second case is exactly what both AI plan paths hit: they load the
// entrant→people map specifically so the block can bite
// (`competition-schedule-ai.ts:442`) and then pin the setting to "warn". Auto
// proposes a board double-booking someone against a fixed card nobody can move,
// Apply 409s, and re-running Auto proposes the same board again — the
// placer/verifier fork, in the one family where the gate is absolute.
