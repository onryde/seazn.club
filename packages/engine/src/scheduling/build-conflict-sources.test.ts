// What a card that is NOT on the answer is told about itself.
//
// `conflictsFor` has three sources, in descending order of how well established
// they are: greedy's own diagnosis, then the blocking conflict that disqualified
// the row, and only then a bare `no_slot`. The ordering is right; the FILTER on
// the first source was not.
//
// `rawSeed.conflicts` is not "what greedy could not do". It also carries rows
// `slotFixtures` emits about cards it DID place — the `commit` person-overlap
// loop, and the locked-clash rows — and source 1 short-circuits the other two.
// So a card greedy PLACED and something later removed (the legalisation pass
// dropping it for a blocking conflict, or z3 dropping one while adding two) was
// reported with a placed card's conflict, and never got its own disqualifying
// row or a `no_slot`.
//
// The visible damage is that the two sides of ONE collision are described
// differently: the card greedy committed first is told which fixture it
// double-booked with, the second is told only that "the locked slot clashes",
// which names nobody and is fed verbatim to the repair prompt.
