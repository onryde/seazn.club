 * `slackMs` is the separation the pair might owe — `maxSeparationMinutes` in ms.
 * Testing bare OCCUPANCY overlap is not enough and was the bug: two fixtures 10
 * minutes apart that owe 45 minutes of rest do not overlap, yet the rest
 * constraint between them is real. The movable×immovable loop in `repair.ts` has
 * always widened its own reach by `max(gapMinutes, rest)`; this is the same
 * widening on the movable×movable side.
