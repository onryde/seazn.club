// Minimal-movement schedule repair (#401).
//
// The solver half. It takes an AI-proposed board the verifier rejects and finds
// the FEWEST fixture moves that make the verifier accept it — minimality by
// ascending k with push/pop, so the first satisfiable k is the minimum by
// construction rather than by an objective function nobody can audit.
//
// Minimal movement is a SAFETY property, not an optimisation: a repair that
// reshuffles a published schedule to save the solver a second has told every
// entrant the wrong time. It is never traded for speed.
//
// Three rules this file obeys without exception:
//
//   1. It never re-derives a rule semantic. Rest amounts, scope coverage,
//      selector resolution and the merged hard-rule stream all come from
//      `calendar.ts`; every calendar decision comes from `repair-domain.ts`.
//      A solver with its own idea of the rules produces boards the verifier
//      rejects, which is the exact lock-out this wave exists to prevent.
//   2. It never loads z3 for a board that already verifies. `z3LoadCount()`
//      makes that a test rather than a promise.
//   3. It never throws on exhaustion. A finite wall-clock budget with a
//      `timeout` result is what lets the caller fall back to LLM repair; an
//      exception there would present an unrepaired plan as a crash.
