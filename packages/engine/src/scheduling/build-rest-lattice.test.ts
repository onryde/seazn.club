// The lattice has to be able to hold the board greedy just produced.
//
// `gridStepMinutes` is `max(REPAIR_GRID_MINUTES, gcd(match, gap))` and never
// reads a rest — while `slotFixtures` chains a participant's next start on
// `lastEnd + rest`. On any config whose rest is not a multiple of that gcd the
// seed therefore sits BETWEEN the lattice's slots, and the effect is not "the
// solver does a bit worse": z3 cannot express the incumbent at all, so the first
// tier bound it is handed (`atMost(<the incumbent's own makespan>)`) makes the
// whole model unsat, every later walk comes back unsat on the first ask, all
// four tiers "complete" with nothing found, and the run reports
// `already_optimal` about a board it never searched.
//
// Measured before the fix, on the first end-to-end case below: `engine:
// "greedy"`, `status: "already_optimal"`, `tiersCompleted: 4`, `budgetExpired:
// false`.
//
// THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO FIX THAT, AND THE CHEAP-LOOKING ONE IS THE EXPENSIVE
// ONE. Folding every rest amount into the step makes the seed land on the grid
// by construction — and collapses the step to the five-minute floor on every
// config whose rest is incommensurate with its pitch, which is an ~8x lattice
// for every board in the system. Measured at the 8 s wall, the same bench at
// `--hard-rest=80` (step 40) against `--hard-rest=45` (step 5): slots at
// n=10/80/140 24/168/288 -> 136/1260/2192, last improving size 80 -> 20,
// `canSolveWithin` admitting n<=80 -> n<=20, and three runs of eighteen killed
// outright by an `ast_manager::register_node_core` OOM inside the WASM — which
// in the bench is a row and in production is the request's whole process.
//
// So the seed is made representable by PINNING it (`seedPinsOf` in `build.ts`,
// `seedPins` in `build-grid.ts`): the incumbent's own `(court, startAt)` pairs
// go into the lattice, which costs O(n) extra slots and only on the boards that
// are off-grid at all. The invariant it buys is the one the tier ladder needs —
// THE SOLVER IS NEVER UNABLE TO EXPRESS ITS OWN INCUMBENT.
//
// The last third of this file is the residue. A pin is refused when the slot is
// inadmissible (a blackout, a session edge, an existing booking) and dropped
// when its court is not configured, and a lattice over `MAX_SLOTS` or a universe
// that ends before the run starts holds nothing at all. Those still leave the
// solver unable to search, and the fix there is to say so
// (`status: "not_searched"`) rather than to claim a proof.
