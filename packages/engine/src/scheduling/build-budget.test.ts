// The run budget (controller ruling R11).
//
// `rlimit` is ONE ALLOWANCE FOR THE WHOLE RUN — every check of every tier, plus
// every window the LNS fallback opens. It used to be none of those things, and
// the reason is a z3 API shape that reads like the opposite of what it does:
//
//   * `solver.set("rlimit", n)` is RE-ARMED ON EVERY `check()`. Measured, on
//     z3-solver 5.0.0: three checks at 50_000 on one solver each returned
//     `sat`, spending ~40_000 apiece — 120_000 against a limit that reads like
//     50_000.
//   * it is a PER-CHECK DELTA, not an absolute threshold. With the context's
//     `rlimit count` already at 86_090, a check at `rlimit: 50_000` still
//     returned `sat` and spent 40_672.
//
// So setting it once, as the solver used to, bounded a CHECK and never a run,
// and the only thing actually stopping a run was the wall-clock backstop — the
// machine-dependent boundary D9 exists to keep OUT of the stopping rule and
// R10 says must never fire at all.
//
// The model below is `build-determinism.test.ts`'s: two courts, a real rest
// rule and a round-robin's worth of shared entrants, so all four tiers have
// something to chew on. MEASURED on it:
//
//   * the whole run, unconstrained, costs 201_748 units and completes 4 tiers;
//   * a SUCCESSFUL check costs ~40_672;
//   * an ABORTED check still costs ~28_500 — told it may spend 10, it spends
//     28_668 — because z3 tests the limit at intervals rather than stopping on
//     it, so every check carries a floor cost it pays regardless.
//
// THE BUDGET HERE IS 100_000, AND THE TWO NUMBERS IT SITS BETWEEN ARE THE WHOLE
// TEST. It is ~2.5x a single successful check, so under the old set-it-once
// behaviour every check has room and the run completes all four tiers, spending
// the full 201_900. It is half what the run costs, so under a run total it
// stops at tier 1 having spent 103_661. Both measured, on both behaviours.
//
// An earlier draft used 60_000 and was TOOTHLESS: that is under 1.5x a
// successful check, so the old behaviour ran out of road too and produced the
// same `budgetExpired: true` and the same early stop. The mutation sweep caught
// it. The lesson is that ~28_500 is what a check that GIVES UP costs, and
// sizing a per-check budget against it measures nothing.
//
// Asserting BOTH the tier count and the spend is deliberate: the tier count
// alone would also move if the model got harder, and the spend alone would also
// move if a check got cheaper.
