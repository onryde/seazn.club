// Where the LNS fallback attaches to `buildSchedule`.
//
// `build-lns.test.ts` owns the pass itself. What is left to pin here is the
// seam, and it is four separate claims: WHEN the pass runs, WHAT it is handed,
// whether its answer is taken, and how the result attributes it. Three of them
// are invisible from a returned board, so they are asserted through a stubbed
// `improveByWindows` (`vi.doMock`, the same instrument `build.test.ts` uses for
// its injected verifier fork).
//
// THE TRIGGER IS A MEASURED BAND, and both of its edges matter. The fallback
// runs only when the tiers fell short AND the run budget has something left, and
// on this model those two overlap in a narrow window:
//
//   rlimit 200-500   tiers 1, main phase charged its 75% share, reserve intact
//   rlimit 600+      tiers 4 — the tiers finish and the fallback is not wanted
//
// `rlimit: 1` used to be the lever and is no longer viable: the main phase's
// allotment is now floored at 1 rather than 0, so it takes a check, and one
// check costs ~382 on this model however small the limit. Deterministic either
// way — `rlimit` is a resource counter, not a clock.

/**
 * AND THE WALL IS HELD OPEN, which is what makes the sentence above true.
 *
 * The seam at `build.ts:1353` gates on `elapsed() < wallMs` as well as on the
 * budget, so under the default 30 s wall the trigger is a resource counter AND
 * a clock — and on a loaded machine the clock wins. Measured: this file passes
 * 6/6 alone and fails `expected [] to have a length of 1` in a full engine run,
 * twice in a row, because ten heavy z3 files start together on twelve cores and
 * boot plus the tiers spend 30 s of wall on a model of two fixtures and one
 * court. Every claim in this file is about WHEN the seam fires; a wall that
 * expires first skips the seam and every one of them reads as a failure — or,
 * worse, as a pass for the wrong reason in the two tests that assert the pass
 * did NOT run.
 *
 * Ten minutes is unreachable at `rlimit: 400`: the budget stops the run three
 * orders of magnitude earlier, so the wall stops participating in the outcome
 * and the run is bounded by the resource counter alone — which is what D9 asks
 * for and what the paragraph above already claimed. A test that reads a clock
 * measures the machine, not the code.
