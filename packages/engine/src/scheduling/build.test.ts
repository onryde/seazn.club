// The build solver's control loop.
//
// The tests here were written against MEASURED greedy behaviour, because
// several of the obvious premises turn out to be false:
//
//   * `slotFixtures` does NOT respect `config.window` — it scans forward for
//     `horizonMinutes` (default 365 days) and will happily place a card outside
//     the competition's own calendar window without a single conflict, while
//     `repairUniverse` bounds z3's lattice to that same window. So "greedy
//     cannot fit these in the window" is not a way to make greedy report
//     `no_slot`; only `sessionWindows`, `blackouts` and the typed rules bound
//     it. Every corner case below is built out of those.
//   * "the solver never returns a board worse than greedy" is NOT
//     `placed >= placed && makespan <= makespan`. D3 is LEXICOGRAPHIC with
//     `placed` on top, so a board that places one more card at a longer
//     makespan is strictly better and that conjunction would refuse it. The
//     contract is `isStrictlyBetter(floor, built) === false`, and that is what
//     is asserted.
//   * the floor is not greedy's board, it is greedy's LEGAL board. Counting a
//     card that carries a blocking conflict as "placed" is what let an illegal
//     greedy board outrank every legal one D3 could reach.
