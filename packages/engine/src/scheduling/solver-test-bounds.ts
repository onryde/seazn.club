// TEST SUPPORT ONLY (#401). Not exported from the scheduling barrel, never
// imported by the solver, and never reachable from `repairSchedule`.
//
// The repair tests assert wall-clock bounds on CPU-bound solver work, and this
// suite runs its files concurrently (`pool: "threads"`) beside whatever else is
// on the host. Measured on this machine: a fixed JS work unit cost 93 ms with
// the box quiet and 464 ms while another workspace's suite ran — five times
// slower, same machine, same code.
//
// Five times slower is enough to change what a test is testing. A 120-fixture
// encode costs 1.2 s at full speed; at 5x it no longer fits inside a 2.5 s
// budget, so the budget expires in the ENCODE, `checks` comes back 0, and a
// test whose whole point is "the budget binds inside the SOLVER, not only
// inside the encode" quietly stops reaching the solver at all. That is how
// three tests came to fail on a loaded host and pass on a quiet one — a suite
// that is green on an idle laptop and red in CI teaches nobody anything.
//
// Two different problems live in that sentence, and they need two different
// tools, which is why this file exports two things:
//
//   1. A bound on how far past its deadline a call may be NOTICED. That is a
//      real quantity that genuinely scales with the host, so it is measured
//      against the host — `measureLoadFactor` + `scaleForLoad`. The factor is
//      1 on a machine as fast as the reference, so the bar on a quiet box does
//      not move, and it rises only in proportion to demonstrated slowness, to
//      a ceiling.
//   2. A SCENARIO that requires the encode to finish so the solver is reached
//      at all. Scaling cannot fix that one honestly: the factor is sampled
//      once, before the run, and contention arriving mid-test would leave the
//      budget short again — the test would go back to passing vacuously on the
//      wrong code path. So the scenario is not estimated, it is OBSERVED:
//      `atABudgetThatReachesTheSolver` raises the budget until the result
//      itself shows the solver was reached, and hands back the budget it took.
//      If it never is, the caller's assertion fails honestly rather than
//      measuring something else. See its own comment.
//
// EITHER WAY IT SCALES TEST BOUNDS ONLY. Neither may ever scale a budget a
// CALLER passes: the web runner sizes its 45 s against `ROUND_TIMEOUT_MS` and
// against two full-ceiling components, and a slow host silently turning that
// into 225 s would leave an HTTP request waiting five times as long as the
// code says it will, invisibly. The honest answer on a slow host is the
// `timeout` and the LLM fallback #401 asks for, plus a number an operator can
// see — not a longer wait arranged behind the caller's back.
//
// `performance.now()` because ambient wall-clock reads are banned engine-wide
// (scripts/engine-boundary.ts), and this is an elapsed span.

/**
 * Run a solver call at the smallest budget, from `from` upward, that actually

 *
 * Some tests are about what the solver's own clock does, and they can only ask
 * that question on a run where the solver was reached: the encode has to fit
 * inside the budget with enough left over that `check()` is entered and times
 * out there. On the authoring machine a fixed budget does that. On a host under
 * contention the same budget is eaten by the encode, the call returns `timeout`
 * with `checks: 0`, and every assertion after it is either vacuous or a false
 * failure.
 *
 * A calibrated multiplier is the wrong instrument for this one. It is sampled
 * once, before the run, so a machine that becomes busy between the calibration
 * and the call is short again — and being short is silent. This is an
 * observation instead: run, ask the RESULT whether the solver was reached, and
 * if not, double the budget and run again. Doubling converges in a step or two
 * at any plausible host speed and needs no constant that can go stale.
 *
 * Two properties matter, and both are deliberate:
 *
 *   - It never weakens an assertion. If every attempt is exhausted without
 *     reaching the solver, the last result is returned unchanged and the
 *     caller's `checks >= 1` fails, loudly, on the real problem.
 *   - It reports the budget it settled on, so the caller can bound the wall
 *     clock against the budget that was ACTUALLY in force rather than the one
 *     it asked for first.
 *
 * `run` is handed a budget and returns whatever the call under test produces;
 * it should do its own timing, because only the final attempt's wall clock
 * means anything.
