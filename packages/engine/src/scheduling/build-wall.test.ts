// lattice the solver returned at **15_368 ms against an 8_000 ms wall** — 92 %
// over — because the only wall tests were at the top of the search loops and
// everything expensive happens outside them: `encodeBuild` (3_706 ms) and the
// first `solver.push()` over the encoded model (9_837 ms). Neither reads the
// clock, so a run whose budget was already gone still paid both in full.
//
// R23 puts the tests where the cost is. R22 exports the gate so the web layer
// can decline the call rather than pay it — and so the threshold lives in one
// place, because a second copy of it is a placer/verifier fork wearing a
// different hat, which is the defect shape this subsystem has hit three times.

  // the board through `buildSchedule` with the wall already gone, then price

  // less than the encode. That needs a board big enough for the encode to
  // dominate, and it cost this suite two separate outages:
  //
  //   * at 200 x 432 fixture-slots the encode poisoned the whole run. The
  //     engine's vitest config is `isolate: false` on a thread pool and z3's
  //     WASM heap only ever GROWS, so one encode that large killed 17 tests in
  //     UNRELATED files — officials/assign.property, testkit/golden,
  //     testkit/simulation — with bare `STACK_TRACE_ERROR`s. `resetZ3()` cannot
  //     hand the memory back.
  //   * at 200 x 216 the ratio itself broke, in BOTH directions. The guarded
  //     arm is `boot + greedy + lattice`, and z3's boot is a fixed ~700 ms that
  //     does not shrink with the board; the encode does. Under a loaded machine
  //     the guarded arm drifted up; under an idle one the encode dropped to
  //     1_287 ms and the assertion failed as `expected 796 to be less than 643`.
  //     There is no board size that fixes both ends, because the two arms scale
  //     differently.

  // run did not encode", and that is directly observable: mock `encodeBuild`
