// The stopping rule is a property of the SEARCH, not of the machine.
//
// `calendar.test.ts` asserts the greedy placer is deterministic, and an anytime
// solver budgeted on the wall clock would break that invariant the moment CI ran
// on a faster box: same competition, same settings, a different board, and no
// way for an organiser to tell why. So the budget is z3's `rlimit` — a
// deterministic resource counter — and every tier walk terminates on a VERDICT
// (unsat, or the metric's own floor) rather than on elapsed time. The wall clock
// survives only as an outer cap that should never fire.
//
// The second test is the one that would actually catch a regression: two runs
// under wall caps four times apart. Under a wall-clock stopping rule they would
// end at different bounds and hand back different boards; here they must be
// byte-identical, and `budgetExpired: false` on both is what proves the cap
// never fired and the comparison is not two truncated runs agreeing by luck.

  // stops opening windows when the caller's outer backstop has fired. That is
  // the same cap the tier loop already honours, but it decides something the
  // tier loop's does not — WHICH windows ran — so it gets its own pair of runs
  // under caps four times apart. The budget below is what puts the run on that
  // path: the tiers fall short of a verdict while the fallback's reserve is
  // still intact (see `build-lns-wiring.test.ts` for the measured band).
  //
  // BOTH CAPS ARE HELD OPEN, and the pair below must never be re-cut downwards.
  // The seam gates on `elapsed() < wallMs` as well as on the budget, so a wall
  // that expires first SKIPS the seam and `lnsWindowRlimits` comes back empty —

  // one full engine run (`expected [] to have a length of 1`) on a TWO-fixture
  // model, and moved to 600 s for this reason. This case is four fixtures on two
  // courts, so it has LESS headroom, not more. At `rlimit: 400` the run ends
