//
// #401 locks "no fixture-count gate — solve the full 500-movable range", and the
// single-solve encoder cannot honour it. Measured: the bare feasibility probe,
// `check(REPAIR_FAMILIES)` with no `AtMost` bound, does not return in 119 s from
// about 80 movable up, at either conflict density; a bigger budget bought
// nothing at 120, 250 or 500. The board is not slow, it is unreachable.
//
// What IS reachable is one component at a time.
//
//   * NOT a partition of `candidatePairs`. That graph is COMPLETE — 124,750 of
//     124,750 pairs at n=500, one component, every size and density — because
//     `span` is blocking-only and the pack window is the only per-fixture
//     blocking interval, so any two cards can be moved onto one court.
//     Partitioning it is a measured dead end.
//   * FREEZE AND COMMIT SEQUENTIALLY. Build the graph over CURRENT PLACEMENTS —
//     same court, or a shared participant, within the separation the pair could
//     owe, plus every order dependency — solve ONE component with the entire
//     rest of the board frozen into `existing`, commit the result, move to the
//     next.
//
// Measured by `scripts/bench-decompose.ts` at a 20 s per-component budget, one
// child process per case, against a single solve that does not return in 119 s
// at any of these sizes:
//
//   | n   | 1-in | comps | max | total ms | k   | lower bound | verdict | after |
//   | 120 |   20 |     9 |  31 |    4 651 |   6 |           6 | proved  |     0 |

// at 500 dense. The graph itself costs 1-2 ms.
//
// Freezing is what makes this sound. The frozen cards go in as `existing`, so
// `repairSchedule` constrains every moved card against all of them — a
// component's repair can no more collide with another component than with an
// outside booking. The graph therefore decides QUALITY (how few moves), never
// legality. The one place it decides more than that is `max_fixtures_per_day`,
// which counts across the whole board; see `dayCapGuard` below.
//
// Two properties this file owes its callers:
//
//   1. ANYTIME. Each component commits independently, so a budget that runs out
//      halfway yields a PARTLY repaired board rather than nothing — and the
//      partial board is put through the real verifier before it is returned. A
//      partial repair the verifier rejects is a bug, not a degraded success.
//   2. HONEST MINIMALITY. Restricting which fixtures may move can only RAISE the
//      number of moves, so a decomposed answer is an UPPER BOUND by
//      construction. It is reported as minimal only when a certificate proves it
//      — see `repair-minimality.ts`.

/**
 * Whether freezing is safe for this config's `max_fixtures_per_day` rules.
 *
 * Freezing converts a card's contribution to a day cap from an `AtMost` literal
 * into a DECREMENT of the bound — `assertDayCap` counts the immovables on each
 * day and asserts `AtMost(movable literals, count - immovable)`. That is exact,
 * but only because both sides count the same cards, and they do not always:
 * `assertDayCap` filters `existing` by `fixtureById.has()`, because an outside
 * booking or a closed court is not a fixture and counting one would invent a cap
 * breach out of a blackout. A PROPOSAL fixture missing from `config.ruleFixtures`
 * is filtered by that same test the moment it is frozen — so the decrement
 * under-counts, the solver believes a day has room it does not, and the verifier
 * rejects a board the solver called repaired. Fourth instance of this wave's
 * dominant bug class: an encoder unit that is not the verifier's unit.
 *
 * On the whole board the mismatch cannot arise, because nothing is frozen: the
 * verifier counts `[...existing.filter(known), ...assignments]` and the encoder
 * bounds exactly those same assignments. So the guard's answer is not to fail —
 * it is to DECLINE TO DECOMPOSE and solve the board whole, which is precisely
 * today's behaviour and therefore never a regression.
 *
 * Exported (C9): solver-agnostic — the mismatch this guards against is a fact
 * about `assertDayCap`'s counting, not about which solver runs a component, so
 * `repair-decompose-cpsat.ts`'s CP-SAT driver reuses this UNCHANGED rather than
 * re-deriving it. See that file's own doc comment.

 * exactly one case: the board it produced disagrees with the real verifier,
 * which is an impossible event and must be loud rather than shipped.
 *
 * SERIALISED PER PROCESS, one component at a time, by the lock `repairSchedule`

 * shared WASM context and its pthreads, so anything running alongside a
 * decomposed repair would have the threads pulled out from under a live
 * `check()` — the same abort the reset exists to prevent, arriving by a
 * different road. Two callers (the division runner and the competition runner)
 * each have their own repair loop and a joint run can have both in flight, so
 * this is not hypothetical.
 *
 * The lock is deliberately NOT held across the whole call. It is taken per
 * component solve and per reset, so a second caller runs BETWEEN two components
 * rather than waiting out a 240 s decomposed budget — and it still never runs
 * DURING one. The budget clock starts when this call's own work does, and time
