// The large-neighbourhood fallback (design D7's "C" half).
//
// When the whole-board model does not converge — a board whose lattice the
// monolithic solve cannot chew through inside its budget, or a tier walk that
// ran out before it proved anything — this spends what is left on WINDOWS
// instead: freeze all but a slice of the board, re-solve that slice with
// everything else immovable, and keep the answer only if the WHOLE board got
// lexicographically better.
//
// --- what a window is re-solved WITH, and why it is not `repairSchedule` -----
//
// The plan sketched this over `repairSchedule`, on the reading that a window is
// a small board and `repair.ts` already solves small boards. It does not solve
// the RIGHT problem. `repairSchedule` minimises the NUMBER OF MOVES needed to
// make a board legal and has no objective beyond that; its first act is a
// verifier precheck that returns `status: "clean"` with zero z3 checks when the
// proposal already validates (`repair.ts:266-278`). Every board this fallback
// is ever handed is already legal — `build.ts` legalises the greedy seed before
// it measures it, and every board a tier accepts has passed the verifier gate —
// so a repair-backed LNS returns its input unchanged, always. Measured on the
// obvious corner: three back-to-back cards on one court with a second court
// standing empty comes back `clean`/`checks: 0`, makespan 90 in and 90 out,
// while the lattice admits 60.
//
// So a window is re-solved by the BUILD solver — the same greedy seed, the same
// `encodeBuild` model, the same four lexicographic tiers — and it is handed the
// WHOLE board: the window's fixtures free, and every other row as a fixture
// `locked` to exactly where it already sits.
//
// THE ROWS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW CANNOT BE PASSED AS `existing`, and this is the
// second false premise in the plan. An `existing` row constrains the model (its
// court time leaves the lattice, its participants still clash) but it is
// INVISIBLE TO THE OBJECTIVE: `boardMetrics` is computed over the rows the
// solve placed, so a window solved in isolation optimises its own slice. Two of
// the three metrics are then measuring the wrong thing, and the makespan is
// worse than wrong — it is translation-invariant, so every start is equally
// good. Measured, and this is exactly what came back: freeze `a` at 09:00 and
// ask for `b` and `c` in a window with `a` as `existing`, and the answer is
// `b@C2+180, c@C1+180` — window makespan 30, a perfect local answer, and a
// board that grew from 90 minutes to 210. `improveByWindows` would reject it
// and the pass would be inert for the same reason the repair version is.
//
// Locking the rest of the board turns the sub-solve's own metrics INTO the
// global metrics, so its tiers optimise the thing that is actually being
// improved. It costs a full-size encode per window — the model is |board|
// fixtures wide either way — and buys the only thing that ever mattered: the
// SEARCH space is the window, because every other placement literal is a unit
// clause z3 propagates at level 0. That is the right trade here, because the
// encode was never the bottleneck: 1.4 s at 200 fixtures against a `check()`
// that returns `unknown` at 20 s.
//
// The solve itself is INJECTED (`solveWindow`) rather than imported, for two
// reasons that both matter: `build.ts` is the only place that knows the config,
// the dependency list, the rlimit and how much of the wall backstop is left,
// and importing `buildSchedule` here would make the module graph circular. It
// also means every decision this file makes — which windows, in what order,
// which answers are kept — is unit-testable without booting the WASM.
//
// --- the window size ---------------------------------------------------------
//
// `LNS_WINDOW_LIMIT` is `COMPONENT_MOVABLE_LIMIT`'s 50, reused deliberately
// rather than picked afresh, so the two solvers' scaling stories stay one
// story: 50 movable is the size `bench-repair.ts` measured as still tractable
// at the dense end.
//
// --- determinism -------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Two runs on identical input must produce identical output on any machine, so
// nothing here reads a clock of its own. The window PLAN is computed once, from
// the board as it arrived, before any window is solved — so which windows run
// does not depend on which earlier windows were accepted — and every ordering
// inside it breaks ties on `fixtureId`. `deadlineMs`/`elapsed` are the caller's
// existing outer liveness backstop (`build.ts`'s `wallMs`), passed in rather
// than read here, and they are a cap that should never fire; the real budget is
// the z3 `rlimit` the injected solve carries (design D9).
