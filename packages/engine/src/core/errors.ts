  // order is asserted in errors.test.ts and read by the API's code → HTTP map.
  // A stamped event's `at` precedes the newest accepted stamp (spec §3.3).
  "NON_MONOTONIC_TIME",
  // `compareGameTime` (core/time.ts) received a period absent from the phase
  // order it was handed. TWO call paths reach it, and naming only the first
  // sent a reader looking in the wrong file: a module's own comparisons inside
  // `apply()` (the sweep, release-on-goal), and the fold kernel's monotonic
  // guard, which compares each stamp against the high-water mark. It is
  // therefore a disagreement between two lists, never a scorer's typo — an
  // `at.period` the module does not declare is refused earlier, by the fold, as
  // INVALID_EVENT. Still a 422: it rejects one event, and paging the on-call
  // gives the scorer nothing.
  "UNKNOWN_PHASE",
  // Expedite in force, `serving` recorded, and a 13-return rally credited to
  // the serving side (spec §5.3). Thrown by `checkExpedite` in
  // `sports/setbased/kernel.ts` — its only throw site.
  "EXPEDITE_WRONG_WINNER",
  // Football substitution beyond `subWindows` or `cfg.maxSubs` (spec §5.2).
  // Declared here, thrown by the football module in a later task.
  "SUB_WINDOW_EXCEEDED",
  // S5 (#431) — a `tennis.game.award` posted while the match is inside a
  // tie-break or match tie-break (nested/kernel.ts `applyGameAward`, its only
  // throw site): the breaker IS the deciding game, so there is no separate
  // game left to concede — conceding a SET would be a genuinely different,
  // undesigned cascade, deliberately out of scope this session.
  "GAME_AWARD_DURING_TIEBREAK",
  // F2 (unified progression field) — placeDescriptors/
  // validateProgressionAgainstShapes moved from apps/web's stage-seeding.ts
  // into the engine; these four codes moved with them, string-for-string, so
  // the wire-visible error.code an existing client sees is unchanged.

  // more than one progression source (two sources sharing a pool key, e.g.
  // both have a "group_rank A1"); placeDescriptors can no longer tell them
  // apart, so it refuses instead of silently resolving to whichever source's
  // copy it visited last. Appended last, existing order frozen.
