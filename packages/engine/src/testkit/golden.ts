// Cross-sport golden-replay harness — W4 step 0 (#407 programme).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `conformance.ts` generates its streams with fast-check at
// run time, so it re-derives its inputs from whatever the schemas currently
// are: it can never prove that a schema change was *additive*. This harness
// freezes a corpus of pre-change event streams to disk and replays them
// against the live module. A committed stream that no longer folds to the
// recorded state — or no longer parses against `eventSchema` — is a
// back-compat break, whatever the version number says.
//
// Generalised from the football-only gate that used to live in
// sports/football/football.golden.test.ts (same mulberry32 seeded walk over
// `module.arbitraryEvent`, same UPDATE_GOLDEN convention, now with per-event
// folded state and an eventSchema re-parse on every recorded payload).
//
// Regenerate ONLY when a fold change is intended:
//   UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 npx vitest run src/testkit/golden.test.ts
//
// Purity note: this file lives in testkit and may touch node:fs. Nothing under
// src/sport/** or src/sports/** may import it — @seazn/engine ships with zero
// runtime dependencies.

 *      tennis's receiver side, both period sports' whole shoot-out `meta` plus
 *      the goal's own period label, cricket's incoming batter, reviewed batter,
 *      umpire target and progressive innings, and the set-based trio's
 *      in-progress set snapshot — by widening the generators under
 *      src/sports/**, always SOMETIMES and never always: a field written on
 *      every event leaves the missing-field fold path exactly as unwalked as
 *      one written on none. `generator-fields.test.ts` is what holds them
 *      closed, and asserts the EXACT (now empty) set of those still blocked.
 *      The last seven were blocked on three fold defects the generator change
 *      merely EXPOSED — two cfg-derived refusals unguarded on the read path
 *      (§3.3) and a coarsener that emitted two partials for one set (§9.6) —
 *      and closing them meant fixing those first, not widening around them.
 *    KERNEL-UNION — the setbased kernel gives volleyball, badminton and
 *      tabletennis ONE event union while each sport's `records` preset
 *      registers a different subset of event types. The union therefore
 *      over-declares for a given sport: the field belongs to a type that sport
 *      cannot record at all, `apply` refuses it BY NAME, and no config reaches
 *      it (`records` is a compile-time preset, not a cfg knob).
 *    CFG — genuinely cfg-gated; prefer a COVERAGE_CONFIGS entry, and both that

// ---------------------------------------------------------- STATE coverage
//
// T2 (#425 follow-up), and the harder half. `SportModule<Cfg, Ev, State>`
// declares no `stateSchema` — `State` is a bare generic and every state shape
// is a plain TS interface never validated at runtime — so there is no schema to
// walk and no declared set to compare against.
//
// WHAT IS ALREADY GUARDED, so the gap is stated exactly. `stateMismatch`
// compares everything outside `cfg` as EXACT STRING equality, so for any path
// the corpus already writes, BOTH directions red today: narrowing or renaming
// changes the replayed string, and a new state key changes it too (which is
// what `REBASELINE_GOLDEN` exists for). Freezing the observed path set would
// therefore only restate, more weakly, an assertion the replay already makes
// byte for byte.
//
// WHAT IS NOT. A state field NO recorded stream writes is invisible to that
// comparison, and the wave's own fields were in exactly that position:
// `overran` and `overCount` are computed only under a `cfg.interruptions`
// allowance that no shipped variant declares, and football's `at` stamp reached
// cards and shoot-out penalties in the live generator while no frozen stream
// carried one. So the gap is COVERAGE, the same gap `uncoveredTierFields`
// closes for payloads.
//
// THE DECLARED SIDE, with no schema: the live modules themselves. A seeded
// sweep of `arbitraryEvent` over every candidate config says which state paths
// the module can produce NOW; the frozen corpora say which it has recorded.
// The difference is the uncovered set. That is self-maintaining in the way a
// hand-kept list is not — add a conditional state field, the sweep reaches it,
// and the gate reds until a stream is appended or the field is allow-listed.
//
// CONSEQUENCE worth knowing before widening a generator: this makes the gate
// sensitive to `arbitraryEvent`. A generator that starts reaching a new state
// path reds here until EXTEND_GOLDEN records one. That is the intended
// behaviour and it is also new blast radius.

/** Every digested step restored to its full state, by re-folding the ledger the
 *  corpus still stores. `outcome`, `summary` and `deltas` are left exactly as
 *  recorded — this restores STATES and nothing else.
 *
 *  This is the recomputability claim the whole of scope item 3 rests on, written
 *  as code rather than as a sentence in a failure message, and it is what keeps
 *  the equivalence proof honest. Once the committed corpora are slim there is no
 *  full corpus left on disk to compare a slim one against, so
 *  `golden-mutations.test.ts` would otherwise degrade into comparing a corpus
 *  with itself — the two "forms" identical, every entry still redding, and the
 *  proof asserting nothing. It derives the full form here instead.
 *
 *  Round-tripping it is also a gate in its own right: `slimCorpus(unslimCorpus(
 *  committed))` must reproduce the committed corpus exactly, which is how a
 *  hand-edited digest or a hand-edited anchor is caught.
 *
 *  A stream that stores no digest is ALREADY full, so it is returned untouched
 *  rather than re-folded. That is not a shortcut that weakens anything — the
 *  re-fold is provably an identity there (`rebaselineCorpus` reports
 *  `changedStates=0` on a corpus that replays, and `keepRecordedConfig` puts the
 *  recorded config back regardless) — it is what keeps this callable from a test
 *  that runs over all eleven modules without paying a full re-fold per module
 *  for nothing. Cricket alone folds ~700 steps.
 *
 *  NEVER USE THIS TO COMPARE TWO VERSIONS OF THE ENGINE. It reconstructs the
 *  missing states by RE-FOLDING the stored ledger with whatever code is loaded
 *  now, so both sides of any before/after comparison come back as the CURRENT
 *  behaviour. In particular
 *
 *      corpusStateDiff(unslimCorpus(before), unslimCorpus(after))
 *
 *  reports `changedStates: 0` for a fold change that moved dozens of recorded
 *  states — measured while landing the set-piece `resolved` counter, where the
 *  true answer was 39 full states and 51 digests across 7 streams. The failure
 *  presents as a REASSURING NUMBER rather than an error, which is why this is a
 *  warning and not a guard: there is no signal to trip on. It is the same
 *  compare-a-thing-with-itself shape the slimming work existed to eliminate,
 *  reintroduced by the function written to recover from it.
 *
 *  The correct comparison is against the RECORDED BYTES: loop `verifyStream`
 *  over `readCorpus(key).streams`, which compares each stored state (or its
 *  digest) with a fresh replay and names what moved. `corpusStateDiff` is
 *  honest when its `after` side is a real `rebaselineCorpus` output and its
 *  `before` side is the committed corpus as read from disk. */

// module, though it cannot change a single fold. That once pushed the period
// family into a compile-time preset field instead of a config field; with the
// subset rule below in place the workaround was unwound, and the set-piece
// kinds are `cfg.setPieceKinds` again (W4 review item 4).
//
// So `cfg` is compared as a SUBSET: every key the golden recorded must still be
// present with an identical value, while new keys are allowed. Everything else
// — key order included — stays exact string equality, because that is the fold

// `{"1":…,"2":…}`, and any comparison that parses BOTH sides and re-serialises
// them normalises the two identically — a genuine order change between the
// recorded and replayed state comes out equal. That is a false GREEN on the
// exact-equality half of the golden comparison, which is the half that carries
// the whole fold.
//
// No corpus has an integer-like state key today. That is the reason to fix it
// now rather than a reason not to: cricket keys innings by `r1`/`r2` and
// several modules key maps by entrant id, so one module numbering a map by
// period, over or board number is all it takes, and the failure mode is a gate
// that reports success.

// ------------------------------------- per-step digests (#429 scope item 3)
//
// WHY. The eleven corpora recorded a full `JSON.stringify(state)` after every
// event — 4,507,821 bytes across eleven single-line files, of which the states
// were roughly 90%. Cricket alone was 1.8 MB. That weight buys one thing the
// harness genuinely needs (a per-step tripwire) and one thing it does not (the
// bytes of every intermediate state, all but a handful of which no human will
// ever read).
//
// WHAT THIS COSTS, stated first because it is the part that is easy to lose.
// Scope item 1 made "reviewed as a state diff" the core of the re-baseline
// policy, and a digest tells a reviewer THAT a step moved and never WHAT moved:
// only the digest was stored, so the previous state is a hash in git too and
// `corpusStateDiff` cannot name a key for it. That is a real degradation and it
// is why the anchors below are chosen by a rule rather than by a stride someone
// liked. It is bounded by one fact: the corpus still stores the `config`, the
// `lineups` and every `event`, so the full state at ANY step is recomputable
// locally — `recomputeStream(module, corpus.configs[stream.config],
// stream.events, stream.lineups).states[N]`. A digest mismatch says so.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT COST. The digest is taken over `comparableStateText` —
// the exact text the byte-exact half of `stateMismatch` compares, with the
// module's config replaced by its placeholder. So it reds on precisely what
// that comparison redded on and tolerates precisely what it tolerated. In
// particular it is ORDER-SENSITIVE (it hashes the recorded source text, member
// by member, in the recorded order) and it keeps the config-subset tolerance,
// which is permanent: hashing the raw state instead would red all eleven
// corpora the next time a knob gains a `.default()`.

/** Marks a `states[i]` entry as a digest rather than a recorded state.
 *
 *  `#` is chosen because it is NOT valid JSON. Every existing reader that walks
 *  the recorded states for a shape already parses inside a `try/catch
 *  { continue }` — `recordedStatePaths` here, `stateShapeOf` in
 *  schema-snapshot.ts, `recordedCfgOf` below — so each of them skips a
 *  digest-only step without being taught about digests at all. Skipping is the
 *  CORRECT behaviour for them, and not by luck: `anchorSteps` keeps every step
 *  at which the state shape grows, so a skipped step contributes no path and no

//   EVERY STRIDE-th STEP, for review. This is the localisation budget: a
//     reviewer looking at a moved digest is at most ANCHOR_STRIDE steps from a
//     stored full state, in both directions, and the harness names the nearest.
//   EVERY STEP AT WHICH THE STATE SHAPE GROWS. This is the clause that makes
//     the anchor set deliberate rather than a sample. Both gates that walk the
//     recorded states — `recordedStatePaths` and, more sharply,
//     `stateShapeOf`, whose output is committed as `<key>.schema.json` under a
//     byte-equality CI gate — union a path/kind set over the states. Keeping

//     construction, so slimming cannot narrow a different tripwire or drop
