// #429 scope item 1 — the golden corpus WRITE POLICY, made enforceable.
//
// The policy is in GOLDEN-POLICY.md next to this file: a re-baseline is
// legitimate only when it is DELIBERATE, ISOLATED IN ITS OWN COMMIT, and
// REVIEWED AS A STATE DIFF. The mechanism for it (`REBASELINE_GOLDEN=1`)
// already existed and enforced none of those three clauses — it would rewrite
// eleven corpora on top of a half-finished branch and print nothing about what
// moved, which produces a commit no reviewer can read: a state that moved
// because the fold changed is indistinguishable from one that moved because
// the tree was dirty.
//
// Both halves under test here are PURE and take their inputs as data — a
// porcelain listing, a pair of corpora — so nothing below manufactures dirty
// git state or runs a re-baseline. The impure wiring is two `execFileSync`
// probes, and the only thing asserted of them is the one behaviour that must
// fail closed: outside a checkout there is no diff to review.
