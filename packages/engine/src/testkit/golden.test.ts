// Back-compat golden replay for every builtin SportModule — W4 step 0.
//
// The corpus in sports/**/<key>.golden.json was frozen against the schemas as
// they were BEFORE the W4 additive extensions. Replaying it proves three
// things the fast-check conformance kit structurally cannot:
//   1. folds are unchanged (per-event state, outcome, summary, standingsDelta);
//   2. payloads recorded under the old schema STILL PARSE under the new one —
//      i.e. the schema change was additive, not a rename/tightening;
//   3. the version only ever moves forward (<=, not ==: minor bumps land next).
//
// Regenerate ONLY when a fold change is intended, and say why in the commit:
//   UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 npx vitest run src/testkit/golden.test.ts
