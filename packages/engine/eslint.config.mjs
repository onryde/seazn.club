// Lint config for @seazn/engine.
//
// Deliberately NOT the apps/web config: that one is built on
// eslint-config-next (core-web-vitals + typescript), which pulls in React,
// JSX, hooks and Next-router rules. The engine is a dependency-free pure
// library — no React, no DOM, no Next — so it gets its own flat config from
// @eslint/js + typescript-eslint and nothing else.
//
// Type-AWARE linting is on (`recommendedTypeChecked`, not `recommended`).
// It costs ~16 s over 179 files, and it is what makes the rules that actually
// matter for this package work at all: no-floating-promises and
// await-thenable over the async z3 bridge, and no-unnecessary-type-assertion,
// which matters more here than anywhere else in the repo — a stale `as X` in a
// kernel silently swallows exactly the type regression the frozen-golden
// corpora exist to catch.
