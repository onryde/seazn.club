# Seazn Club

**Run any tournament, for any sport, in any format** — from a 4-player club night to a
multi-season regional league.

Seazn Club is a multi-tenant tournament management SaaS. Organisers create competitions
and divisions, enter live results, and share public standings and schedules. The product
differentiator is a **sport-aware tournament engine** with per-sport scoring fidelity
(cricket innings, football shootouts, volleyball sets, chess Swiss pairing) rather than
generic win/loss brackets.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`apps/web/`](apps/web/) | Next.js app — UI, API routes, billing, auth, public dashboard |
| [`packages/engine/`](packages/engine/) | Pure TypeScript tournament engine (`@seazn/engine`) |
| [`engine/`](engine/) | Engine v2 **design corpus** (PROMPT-00–15 landed) — domain model, sport specs, implementation prompts |
| [`development/`](development/) | Product & platform **design docs** — billing, security, realtime, phased plan |
| [`supabase/`](supabase/) | PostgreSQL schema + ordered migrations |
| [`openapi/`](openapi/) | Generated OpenAPI spec for `/api/v1` |
| [`scripts/`](scripts/) | DB bootstrap, engine checks, smoke tests, OpenAPI generation |

This is an npm workspace monorepo. Root scripts delegate to `apps/web` and
`packages/engine`.

---

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| App | Next.js App Router, React 19, TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Supabase) via the `postgres` package — no Supabase client SDK for queries |
| Auth | bcrypt + `jose` JWT in httpOnly cookie; active org in a separate cookie |
| Realtime | Supabase Realtime broadcast (live scoreboards) |
| Storage | Supabase Storage (org logos, player avatars) |
| Billing | Stripe (flat per-org pricing) |
| Email | Resend |
| Cache / rate limits | Upstash Redis (optional; falls back to Postgres) |
| Observability | Sentry |

**Hosting (locked):** Vercel or Fly.io for the app, Supabase for Postgres. See
[`development/02-architecture.md`](development/02-architecture.md) for the target topology.

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  apps/web — modular monolith                            │
│  Server Components · /api routes · webhooks · public UI │
└──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                           │ imports (pure logic only)
┌──────────────────────────▼──────────────────────────────┐

└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Two engines, one contract** (see [`engine/03-engine-architecture.md`](engine/03-engine-architecture.md)):

1. **Match Engine** — per-sport `SportModule` plugins own fixture scoring: event
   vocabulary, live state, validity, outcome.
2. **Competition Engine** — sport-agnostic core owns progression: stage graphs, fixture
   generation, standings, tiebreaker cascades.

The DB adapter persists events and derived snapshots; business rules never live in SQL.

### Engine modules (implemented)

| Module | Sports |
|--------|--------|
| `boardgame` | Chess, generic 1v1 |
| `setbased` | Volleyball, badminton, table tennis |
| `football` | Association football |
| `cricket` | T20 / ODI / 100-ball variants, NRR, DLS hook |
| `generic` | Fallback win/loss scoring |

Scheduling: round-robin (circle method), Swiss pairing, brackets, calendar slotting.
Conformance tests live in `packages/engine/src/testkit/`.

The [`engine/`](engine/) folder holds the full greenfield design — sport deep-dives,
greenfield schema, API design, entitlements matrix, and ordered
[`engine/prompts/`](engine/prompts/) for incremental implementation. Most prompts are landed
in `packages/engine` and `apps/web`; each design wave under [`design/`](design/) ships as
an ordered `PROMPT-*` batch (see status table below for per-wave status).

---

## Implementation status

Design corpus lives in [`design/`](design/) as ordered `PROMPT-*` waves. Waves v2, v3, v5,
v6–v13 are complete and merged to `main`. v4, v14 and v15 are designed, not yet built.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- PostgreSQL (local or Supabase project)

### Install

```bash
npm ci
```

### Environment

One env file, and it lives at the repo root. `apps/web/.env.local` is a **symlink** to it,
so the dev server, the `db:*` scripts and vitest all read the same values. Both paths are
gitignored, so recreate the symlink in every fresh clone or worktree:

```bash
cp apps/web/.env.example .env.local
ln -sf ../../.env.local apps/web/.env.local
```

Required for local dev:

- `DATABASE_URL` — Supabase transaction pooler (port 6543) or local Postgres
- `AUTH_SECRET` — `openssl rand -hex 32`

Optional but needed for full feature coverage: Supabase keys (realtime, storage), Stripe
(test keys), Resend, Google OAuth. See [`apps/web/.env.example`](apps/web/.env.example)
for the full list.

### Cloudflare Stream (relay tier)

The streaming programme's Tier B relay publishes a phone's feed into a Cloudflare Stream
live input, pulls it back into a headless browser, and re-encodes to the club's
destination. It is wired behind `RELAY_DRIVERS`
([`apps/web/src/server/relay/drivers.ts`](apps/web/src/server/relay/drivers.ts)): unset,
empty or `fake` runs in-memory Cloudflare and Fly doubles with no network — every local
run and every test — and `live` calls the real APIs. Live mode needs an account and a
Stream-scoped token:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` — the account live inputs are created under
- `CLOUDFLARE_STREAM_TOKEN` — scoped to Stream; server-side only, never a `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` var, never reaches the browser

`RELAY_KEK` is required in both modes (it seals every stored stream key). Live mode also
refuses without `ENV_NAME`, and live composed streams need `FLY_API_TOKEN`,
`FLY_RELAY_APP` and `RELAY_IMAGE`. These refusals are LAZY: each fires at the first relay
call that needs the value (a composed start's Machine, the daily sweep), not at boot — a
deploy missing one starts and serves until then. The relay block of the root
[`.env.example`](.env.example) documents each one.

Two facts worth knowing before reading the design:

- `stream.liveInputs.create()` returns `{ uid, rtmps, srt, webRTC }` from a single call,
  so both ingest credential shapes are in hand without a second request. That is why the
  QR contract carries both rather than choosing one at provision time.
- `timeoutSeconds` is nested under `recording` and governs when a disconnect starts a new
  recorded video. It does **not** describe what a playback connection sees while an input
  is disconnected — that is the open question the U1 spike exists to settle, and the
  composited tier's "the encoder never restarts" property rests on the answer.

**Measured behaviour of this API — read before writing against it:**
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-11-cloudflare-stream-measured.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-11-cloudflare-stream-measured.md).
Nine findings taken first-hand against the live API, four of which contradicted
the design and three of which would have shipped green: settings accepted with a
200 and silently ignored, a healthy manifest that 403s a non-browser client, and
recordings that keep billing after their live input is deleted.

For any Cloudflare work, load the `cloudflare` skill rather than working from memory:
limits and API shapes move, and the skill retrieves current docs.

### Database

Apply schema and migrations (local dev or CI bootstrap):

```bash
npm run db:apply
```

> **Warning:** `scripts/apply-schema.ts` drops data — use only on empty local databases.
> Production/staging should run migrations incrementally.

Sync the sport catalog from the engine registry after schema apply:

```bash
npm run sync:sports
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev        # Next.js dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # production build
npm run start      # serve production build
```

---

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start the web app in development |
| `npm test` | Vitest in `apps/web` + `packages/engine` |
| `npm run test:smoke` | End-to-end HTTP smoke test (needs running server + DB) |
| `npm run engine:boundary` | Enforce zero-I/O boundary on `@seazn/engine` |
| `node --experimental-strip-types scripts/migrate-v1-to-v2.ts --dry-run` | v1→v2 data migration (idempotent; see script header) |
| `npm run db:apply` | Apply `schema.sql`, migrations, and `schema_v2.sql` |
| `npm run sync:sports` | Sync sport catalog from engine registry to DB |
| `npm run openapi:gen` | Regenerate `openapi/v1.json` |
| `npm run check:rls` | Fail if any `org_id` table lacks an RLS policy |

---

## Testing & CI

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push and PR:

1. **Unit + typecheck** — TypeScript, engine checks, OpenAPI drift gate, Vitest
2. **Security** — gitleaks secret scan, `npm audit` (advisory)
3. **Smoke** — Postgres container → `db:apply` → RLS check → integration tests → dev
   server → HTTP smoke test

Integration tests under `apps/web/src/server/` and `apps/web/src/lib/__tests__/` require
`DATABASE_URL`. `apps/web/vitest.config.ts` loads the root `.env.local`, so a bare
`npx vitest run` picks it up; without a `.env.local` (CI) the vars must come from the
environment, or ~700 tests skip and the run still reports green. The **Smoke** job runs
both directories against a real Postgres.

The smoke test needs `DATABASE_URL` (DB-backed suites skip silently without it). Stripe
Connect destination charges — sponsor-package checkout **and** registration entry-fee
checkout (RS006) — additionally need `STRIPE_CONNECT_TEST_ACCOUNT`: a *real* test-mode
connected account id with charges enabled, since smoke's fabricated `acct_smoke_*` id is
rejected by Stripe. Without it those assertions are skipped, not failed, and the check
count is unchanged. `npm run stripe:connect-fixture` creates the account (idempotent —
re-running with a healthy account already set just verifies it and exits); a fresh
Express account still needs Stripe's own hosted onboarding completed once by hand
(test-mode data — see the script's own header for why this can't run headless), after
which the id it prints is durable. See [`apps/web/.env.example`](apps/web/.env.example).

## Conventions

These apply across app and engine code:

- **Types first** — Zod schema + inferred type before behaviour
- **Thin API routes** — parse → authorize → delegate to a server-only module; wrap in `handler()`
- **Pure vs effectful** — tournament math in `@seazn/engine` or pure lib modules; DB and side effects in transactional server modules (`import "server-only"`)
- **Entitlement gate** — all paid capability checks go through one helper, enforced server-side and reflected in UI
- **Engine boundary** — no `postgres`, `fetch`, `Date.now()`, or `Math.random()` inside `packages/engine`
