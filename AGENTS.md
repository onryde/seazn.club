# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

## Compact instructions
When compacting, preserve: current task state, files touched this
session, decisions made, and the latest test results.
Drop: full file contents already committed, exploration dead ends,
and resolved error output.

## Orchestration (long sessions)

Main thread is the orchestrator, not the reader. Every file dump pulled
into main context is a permanent tax on the rest of the session.
Delegate reads; keep decisions. Full rationale and the wave recipe:
`docs/agent-playbook.md` — read it before running a multi-task wave.

**Delegate vs inline.** Broad fan-out ("where is X", "what calls Y",
"map this dir") → `scout` or `Explore`. Scoped task with acceptance
criteria → `implementer`. Diff review before commit → `reviewer`.
Known file + known symbol + one fact → do it inline; a subagent spawn
costs more than the answer. Never delegate a search *and* run it too.

**Every dispatch carries five things** or the agent guesses: exact file
paths, acceptance criteria, what NOT to touch, the verify command to
run, and an output cap. Default cap: "final message under 15 lines —
counts, paths, deviations, blockers; no file contents or diffs."

**Parallel only when file sets are provably disjoint.** Ownership lists
do not hold: a production change routinely forces a test-file edit into
someone else's lane. Overlap → sequential, or `isolation: "worktree"`.

**Never accept "done, tests pass"** without the raw counts pasted back.
Rerun the gate yourself at the wave boundary.

## Environment setup

Standing up a local environment — a fresh DB, a worktree, a prod server
for smoke or e2e — has an ordered recipe, and several of the obvious
shortcuts return HTTP 200 or exit 0 while serving, testing or compiling
the wrong thing. **Follow the `seazn-local-env` skill**
(`~/.claude/skills/seazn-local-env/SKILL.md` — invoke it with the Skill
tool, or just read the file; it is machine-local, so a fresh clone on
another machine will not have it). Its §5 also lists the environmental
red signatures here, so an environment fault is not reported as a defect.

The two that cost the most, if you read nothing else: `db:apply` alone is
NOT a fresh schema (it needs `sync:sports`, or `funnel.test.ts` fails
`expected 'generic' to be 'badminton'`), and a `pg_ctl` that fails with
"Address already in use" is followed by a `createdb` that SUCCEEDS —
against another session's server. Confirm `show data_directory` is yours.

## Verification traps in this repo

Tool wrappers here lie in specific, repeatable ways. Assume these
before diagnosing a real bug:

- `rtk` vitest summaries print `PASS(0) FAIL(0)` for a suite that
  **failed to collect**, and swallow exit codes. Judge green only from
  `--reporter=json --outputFile` (`numPassedTests`/`numTotalTests`).
- `rtk` hides `npm run lint` output entirely; "ESLint output (JSON
  parse failed)" is the wrapper losing the result, not a clean run.
  Use `rtk proxy` and read `✖ N problems`.
- `npm test --workspace apps/web -- run <path>` treats positionals as
  **filename filters** — a typo silently runs a subset and reports
  green. Also: unset `DB_SCHEMA` and `--root` each under-report.
- `grep` reports files here as `Binary file … matches` and hides the
  lines. Always `-a` before concluding a call site does not exist.
- A killed background command reports **exit code 0** — that 0 is the
  SIGTERM. Have the command write `EXIT=$?` itself.
- **Shell cwd can reset to the main checkout between calls.** A verify
  run launched from a worktree then silently executes on `main` and
  returns a false green (12 tests, none of yours). Prefix
  `cd <abs worktree> &&` in the *same* call, and confirm the resolved
  paths in `.testResults[].name` before believing a count.
- **`git stash` in a worktree is not safe here** — the stash stack is
  shared with the main checkout. A no-op `stash push` followed by `pop`
  pops a *pre-existing foreign* stash and leaves `package.json` /
  `package-lock.json` unmerged, which blocks every commit in the tree.
- Assertions on a Next HTML body must anchor on `="` — React serialises
  an omitted prop as `"$undefined"`, so a bare `data-*` probe passes in
  both states.

## Standing project rules

- **Read `docs/superpowers/RULES.md` first.** Owner's full standing
  policy — skills to actually use (not just cite), TS7/Node26, agent
  topology (Scout/Implementer/Reviewer, all Sonnet, xHigh for
  Implementer/Reviewer), all 4 required test types per task
  (unit/E2E/smoke/regression), greenfield schema stance, mobile+desktop
  UI bar, pre-commit OpenAPI drift check, and the no-new-issues /
  fix-inline-unless-blast-radius rule. Every dispatch brief should
  restate the relevant parts inline or point here explicitly.
- **`.github/workflows/e2e.yml` is LIVE on pull requests** (owner-confirmed
  2026-08-14). It was disabled for a long time and this file said "never
  enable it", which is why several sessions still assume e2e is local-only —
  it is not. Six Playwright jobs run per PR, including the seven-width
  mobile/tablet matrix and a flag-forced scorepad-v2 job. Two consequences:
  an edit to that file's CONTENTS now affects live CI rather than being dead
  weight, and e2e coverage no longer has to be argued for locally. Verifying
  locally as well is still useful (prod build + `E2E_PROD_TARGET`) — CI is
  the arbiter, not the only signal.
- Smoke CI runs on **PRs only** — merging locally and pushing to `main`
  skips it. Behavior changes need a PR or a local full-smoke first.
- Every change ships a test that fails without it.
- Any new or changed user-facing string → all 4 locale dictionaries,
  never hardcoded English. `content/help/**` is the exception: one
  English tree, no i18n work owed.
- UI work is verified by screenshot at desktop (1280), **320px**, and
  **768px**, with no horizontal page scroll at any of them; the
  seven-width e2e matrix (320/360/375/390/430/768/834, `mobile.spec.ts`
  projects) is the enforcement backstop. `/admin` is staff-only —
  functional bar, skip design polish; every other surface keeps full
  polish.
- New branches go in a worktree; never check out in the main repo dir.

## Live programmes — read the index before touching their code

Some areas carry rulings that are NOT derivable from the code and that
a fresh session will otherwise re-derive wrongly. If your task touches
one, read its index first. Cross-programme sequencing and gates:
`docs/superpowers/specs/bench-product-value/_MASTER.md`.

- **Scoring / sport modules / the scoring pad / fidelity tiers** →
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-scoringpad-v2-prompts/_INDEX.md`
  (decision log, false premises found, session status), then
  `_RULES.md` beside it. Design of record:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-03-scoringpad-v2-design.md`.
  Two rulings that bite immediately: the fidelity band scale is
  **closed at 0–3** (no tier 4, ever), and engine comments citing
  **"doc 14" point at a document that does not exist** — the scale's
  semantics live in `packages/engine/src/sport/module.ts`, nowhere else.
