 * Idle seconds before a pooled connection is closed. Was 20; 60 since

 *
 * WHY. fly.toml and fly.stg.toml both run an HTTP check on `/api/health`
 * every 30 s, and that route runs `select 1` on THIS pool. At 20 s, on an
 * otherwise idle machine, each check found the pool drained and re-dialled —
 * ~2,880 reconnects per machine per day, about 17.3k of the ~24.7k reconnects
 * in 6 days that prod pg_stat_statements showed. Each reconnect pays a TLS
 * handshake, postgres.js's array-type fetch (the `select b.oid, b.typarray
 * from pg_catalog.pg_type …` query) and the loss of that connection's prepared
 * statements. The value must stay ABOVE the health-check interval or the churn
 * returns; db-options/db-singleton tests read every root fly*.toml to enforce
 * that.
 *
 * THE ACCEPTED TRADE. Because the health check touches the pool every 30 s,
 * the pool never drains on a running machine, so every Fly suspend freezes at
 * least one open socket (at 20 s about 2/3 of suspends already did). A socket
 * frozen across a suspend longer than ~39 min — the DB server's TCP keepalive
 * declaring the frozen peer dead (≈1800 s + 9×60 s probes, per the Supabase
 * settings observed 2026-09-24; not configured in this repo) — may fail the
 * first query after resume: postgres.js does not retry an in-flight query.
 * Staging (`min_machines_running = 0`) suspends constantly and will surface it
 * first. The owner accepted this trade; the evidence behind it lives in the
 * public-hub query perf plan's Decisions block, not here.
 *
 * fetch_types must stay on — postgres.js 3.4.9 registers ALL array parsers
 * (text[]/uuid[] included) via it; off ⇒ arrays come back as '{a,b}' strings
 * and any(${ids}) throws. See __tests__/db-array-types.test.ts. getClient()
 * passes it EXPLICITLY: an explicit option beats the URL, and a
 * `?fetch_types=false` query param would otherwise turn it off from a
 * connection string nobody reviews. (PGFETCH_TYPES cannot: postgres.js keeps
 * env values as uncoerced strings, so "false" is truthy.)

// ─── The nesting guard ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE BUG IT EXISTS FOR. `withTenant` is `getClient().begin()`, which PINS one
// connection of a `max: 5` pool for the whole callback. Anything inside that
// callback which asks the pool for a SECOND connection — a query on the pooled
// `sql` proxy (an entitlement helper, a cache-miss lookup) or another
// `withTenant` — is a self-deadlock waiting for load: five concurrent requests
// reaching such a line pin all five slots and queue for a sixth that can never
// exist. postgres.js has NO queue-wait timeout, so it is permanent. The process
// sits at ~0% CPU serving static routes 200 while every DB-touching route,
// `/api/health` included, hangs for ever. Observed live twice on 2026-08-05.
//
// WHY A RUNTIME GUARD AND NOT A GREP. The nesting is almost never visible at
// the call site: `assertCompetitionNotFrozen(orgId, id, tx)` reads as though
// passing `tx` made it safe, and it did not — the helper it delegates to opens
// with `getLimit`, which is pooled, before the `tx` branch is ever reached. A
// static sweep over that shape under-reports, and the transitive call graph is
// deep enough (usecase -> freeze helper -> getLimit -> resolve -> cache miss ->
// query) that "does this path touch the pool" is not a question source code
// answers reliably. Asking the RUNTIME is exact.
//
// OFF BY DEFAULT, AND PRODUCTION NEVER ENTERS IT. Without the env var set
// `withTenant` does not even establish the AsyncLocalStorage context, so the
// cost is one `process.env` read per transaction and the behaviour is
// byte-identical to having no guard at all. It is a test instrument, not a
// production safety net.
