/**
 * Register non-critical tail work. Registration itself never delays the
 * caller: in a Next request scope, `after()` receives the real work promise
 * and awaits it in its after-window (so it genuinely finishes before the
 * window closes, even on error/redirect/notFound); outside a request scope
 * (vitest, scripts) it falls back to inline fire-and-forget. Either way the
 * work's own errors are swallowed, not thrown — same contract as
 * fire*Revalidate's try/catch.
