// plan_entitlements — it is a one-off top-up, so this is the single source for
// the number the pricing card quotes. Pinned by pricing-cards.test.ts.

// ENTITLEMENTS V18 / W2 T5 (design R9, owner ruling 2026-09-03): the grant is
// now PER RUNG — M grants 25, L grants 35. It was flat, and the reason recorded
// for that (`L buys a bigger competition, not more credits`) was reversed: a
// bigger competition is exactly the one that needs more AI scheduling.
//
// W2 T12 (owner ruling 2026-09-03) re-cut L from 50 to 35, in the same pass
// that took Pro's monthly grant 35 -> 25 and its trial 20 -> 15 (V394). The
// rungs still differ — that is the whole point of pricing the grant — but L is
// no longer double M. Every figure in the copy that quotes it moved with this
// line; `passCreditGrantFaults` / `passCreditProseFaults` /
// `localeCreditGrantFaults` (lib/copy-truth.ts) read the constant, so a half
// update reds rather than shipping.
