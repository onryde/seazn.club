/**
 * Does an Event Pass rung lift anything the org's PLAN does not already give it?
 * (v17 gap #327.)
 *
 * Shipping the L rung (#294) broke the assumption every pass surface was built
 * on. Pro was a strict superset of the pass, so under a paid plan the pass was
 * moot and the product refused to sell one. That stopped being true:
 *
 *   | | entrants.per_division.max | divisions.per_competition.max |
 *   |---|---|---|
 *   | Pro | 256 | unlimited |
 *   | Event Pass M | 128 | 10 |
 *   | Event Pass L | **unlimited** | 20 |
 *
 * Neither contains the other. A Pro organiser running one division with more
 * than 256 entrants had no self-serve path at all: the checkout refused them and
 * the upgrade page told them their plan already covered it.
 *
 * Owner decision: open the gate where — and only where — the rung genuinely
 * exceeds the plan. Not "L is special": the comparison is computed from
 * `plan_entitlements`, so it stays true when either side is repriced, and it
 * closes again by itself if Pro's entrant cap is ever lifted.

 * it with the cap rule would call the pass's 4% "better" than Pro's 2% and then,
