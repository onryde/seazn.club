// Help-centre link registry (v3/06 §3). Client-safe on purpose — <Tip> runs
// in the browser and cannot walk content/help, so the article slugs are
// listed here and the stale-doc test (help-content.test.ts) proves this list
// and the Markdown files on disk agree in BOTH directions. A slug outside the
// registry resolves to null and "Learn more" simply doesn't render — never a
// dead link.
