// Extra-organisation recurring add-on (v17 gap #293, design/v17-pricing-
// entitlements SPEC-2 §3/§7). Structurally like lib/seat-addons.ts — a
// RECURRING line item that rides the billing group's EXISTING subscription as
// an extra subscription item (one invoice, one cycle, Stripe-native proration,
// never a second subscription) — but the catalog is an array keyed BY PLAN,
// where extra_seat has a single flat rate.
//
// THE CATALOG HOLDS EXACTLY ONE ENTRY TODAY: `pro` (config/stripe-plans.json
// `org_addons`, lookup_key `seazn_extra_org_pro_monthly`). Entitlements v18
// (V393) retired `pro_plus`, so there is no second rate and no "one flat rate
// would let Pro + extras undercut Pro Plus" argument left to make. The other
// live plans have no rider for their own reasons: `community` because passing
// the free organisation is an upgrade rather than a purchase, and `enterprise`
// because V393 made its `orgs.max_owned` unlimited (NULL) — there is no ceiling
// to lift, so there is nothing to sell. The per-plan SHAPE is kept because a
// second tier may legitimately price differently if one is ever added back, not
// because two rates exist now.
//
// Rates live in config/stripe-plans.json and are deliberately not restated in
// prose here — the "$9 / $19" this comment used to quote was stale on both the
// tier list and the number.
//
// Whatever the entries, every one of them lifts the SAME feature by the SAME
// amount — only the PRICE may differ — so featureKey/deltaEach are pinned ONCE
// below (ORG_ADDON_FEATURE_KEY/ORG_ADDON_DELTA_EACH), exactly like SEAT_ADDON
// pins them for its one entry; only the lookup_key varies.

 * NOT `extraOrgPrice()` (lib/currency.ts), and the difference is a wrong number
 * rather than a stylistic one. That helper reads the PLAN's graduated `up_to:
 * "inf"` tier — what one more organisation costs INSIDE the plan's cap, on the
 * plan's own interval. The two agree monthly and diverge annually, because the
 * plan discounts a year paid up front and this rider never does: on today's usd
 * catalog an annual Pro group's existing extra organisations cost 6399/year
 * each, while this rider is 699/MONTH (8388/year, about 31% more) on a separate
 * monthly cadence. Quoting the tier to an annual group would understate the
 * rider by roughly a quarter and imply a yearly charge that will arrive
 * monthly. Those figures are config/stripe-plans.json's, quoted only to show
 * the SIZE of the error — the code reads the file, never these numerals.
 *
 * So the interval is not a parameter: every catalog entry is a monthly
 * recurring price (`org-addon-catalog-parity.test.ts` pins `interval: "month"`
 * for each one), and any surface rendering this number must SAY monthly.
 *
 * Keyed on the group's CURRENT `plan_key`, never on what the customer last
 * paid. With a single entry in the catalog (`pro`) a plan change can only move
 * the rider on or off, but `setExtraOrgs` swaps the item onto the new plan's
 * lookup_key either way — so if a second priced tier is ever added back the
 * rate follows the plan, and the old rate is not what they will be billed.
 *
 * Returns null when the plan has no rider SKU — today that is every plan except
 * `pro` (community, enterprise and both event passes), so the caller has
 * nothing to sell and must not render a price at all.
