 * prior version filtered `subscriptions.status in ('trialing', 'active',
 * 'past_due')` before granting anything — so a churned subscription
 * (`canceled`, `incomplete`, ...) was skipped by the query entirely and its
 * org got 0 credits forever, even though `orgPlanKey` (entitlements.ts)
 * already resolves that SAME row to `'community'` for every other
 * entitlement read (hasFeature, getLimit, the billing page). This sweep now
 * scans every subscription with a live org — no status filter — and calls
 * `orgPlanKey` per wallet to learn what it should ACTUALLY be granted, so a
 * churned org gets its Community 10/mo like any other Community wallet
 * instead of silently nothing. No retroactive back-grant for months already
 * missed (v17-gap design decision) — this only fixes the sweep going
 * forward. Two visible deploy-day effects follow from that, both expected:
 * a wallet ALREADY granted this month (a trialing group, say) is not topped
 * up to a newly-resolved rate mid-month — `grantMonthly`'s
 * `monthly:${walletId}:${period}` key short-circuits it to a no-op until the
 * next period — and conversely the FIRST sweep to reach a previously-skipped
 * (churned) wallet expires whatever stale grant bucket it was still carrying
 * before granting the resolved rate, so that wallet's balance visibly DROPS,
 * one way, to the Community 10; that is the correct outcome of D1's
 * use-or-lose grant meeting a wallet the old sweep had frozen, not a
 * regression.
 *
 * **Why one scan of `subscriptions` reaches every wallet:** every org has a
 * `subscriptions` row — `lib/auth.ts`'s `createOrgForUser` inserts a
 * Community group-of-one and stamps `organizations.subscription_id` with it
 * in the same transaction as the org itself, so an ungrouped org is simply a
 * group of one — which is why scanning `subscriptions` with the live-org
 * lateral below covers every wallet in a single pass, with no second scan
 * over ungrouped orgs. (`countOrgsWithoutGroup`, run daily by the
 * billing-quantity cron, is the standing alarm on that invariant.)
 *
 * **Which org answers for the group:** `orgPlanKey` takes a single org id,
 * but a wallet can back several orgs (a billing group). The `rep` lateral
 * below picks the SAME representative `lib/billing-group.ts`'s
 * `groupOrgLimit` does — the oldest LIVE org that is not suspended, falling
 * back to a suspended one only if every org in the group is suspended — so
 * a single suspended member cannot silently change which plan the whole
 * group's credits resolve against. Re-implemented as SQL here rather than
 * imported: `billing-group.ts` imports `lib/entitlements.ts` (for
 * `getLimit`), which imports `lib/credits.ts` (for `walletIdFor`) — so
 * `credits.ts` importing FROM `billing-group.ts` would close a second,
 * avoidable cycle on top of the one this file already takes on for
 * `orgPlanKey`. Keep this ORDER BY in step with `groupOrgLimit`'s by hand
 * if that one ever changes. The `live` lateral's predicate carries a SECOND
 * hand-sync obligation: `subscription_id = s.id and deleted_at is null` must
 * stay identical both to the `rep` lateral's filter above (or the
 * representative could come from outside the set being counted) and to
 * `syncGroupQuantity`'s own active count (`billing-groups.ts`, the
 * `count(*) ... where subscription_id = $1 and deleted_at is null` it feeds
 * to the Stripe item) — that agreement is exactly what makes a trialing
 * group's grant match the quantity its trial-end invoice will bill.
 *
 * A representative org that is itself community-suspended (a fully
 * moderation-suspended group) grants flat Community — a deliberate,
 * minimal reading of #290 that does NOT special-case that edge the way
 * `groupOrgLimit` special-cases the ORG CAP; see the plan task that added
 * this function for the reasoning.
 *
 * **Trial grant scales to live orgs, not the frozen paid count (#291):**
 * `syncGroupQuantity` (#279) freezes `quantity_paid` at its pre-trial
 * baseline for the whole trial — a second org that joins mid-trial rides
 * free and raises the ACTIVE org count without moving `quantity_paid` (by
 * design: nothing has been billed yet). Granting on the frozen
 * `quantity_paid` alone would under-grant that org's own seat's worth of
 * credits, so a trialing PAID wallet's quantity is `max(quantity_paid,
 * liveOrgCount)` — never less than what's actually live, and never less than
 * what was actually paid for either (a customer who bought 3 seats and had
 * orgs leave mid-trial keeps granting on 3). A trialing wallet whose
 * representative org RESOLVES to community still grants the flat 1: the
 * `community` arm is checked first, on purpose. #279's own tests
 * (`billing-group-trial-seat.test.ts`) assert `quantity_paid` itself stays
 * frozen — this reads `live_org_count` alongside it rather than touching
 * that column, so both stay true at once.
 *
 * **Anchor (README §7 item 7): calendar month for EVERY wallet, paid or
 * Community — never `current_period_end`.** SPEC-2 §5.4's Cadence rule is
 * explicit that the grant is monthly *regardless of billing cadence* (an
 * annual Pro at $159/yr must still get 60/mo × 12, not a single 720 lump),
 * so `grantMonthly`'s own `monthlyPeriod()` (UTC `YYYY-MM`) is the only
 * anchor this function uses.
 *
 * One wallet's failure (a bad plan_key, a transient DB error) is logged and
 * skipped rather than aborting the whole sweep, matching
 * `reconcileGroupQuantities`'s per-group try/catch — `failed` is returned
 * so the caller (the cron route, then `billing-grant-stg.yml`) can warn on a
 * persistent per-wallet grant failure instead of it going unnoticed.

 *
 * **Nets refunds via the ref link, not a tag.** A failed run's `release()`
 * writes a `source='refund'` row with `ref = hold.id` and NO `spent_by_org_id`
 * (it doesn't re-tag the org), so the derive nets each hold by summing the

 * `source='refund'` but `ref` = a payment-intent id, never a `run_spend` row
 * id, so they can't match a hold here.
 *
 * **Period bound** = `utcMonthStart()` (#292), the same UTC calendar-month
 * anchor `grantMonthly`'s `monthlyPeriod()` resets on — so the cap resets
 * implicitly with the grant cycle, and the two can never independently
 * compute "this month" and disagree (a prior version compared against bare
