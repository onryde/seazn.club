// stripe-plans.json-backed `passPrice` for the same reason — one price list,

/**
 * Which localised sentence a failed checkout gets, from the HTTP status alone.

 * `err.message` on an unexpected 500 — so a Stripe or Postgres exception string
 * is one unhandled throw away from being rendered to a buyer as purchase
 * advice. Mapping on status makes that structurally impossible.
 *
 * Five buckets, and the 4xx one is deliberately NOT narrowed to "bad rung":
 *
 *   409  a previous payment for this competition was taken and then REFUSED by
 *        the mint guard (v17 gap #326), so the sale is frozen until staff
 *        resolve it. Split out of the 4xx bucket because that bucket's whole
 *        premise — "the page is out of date, reload and try again" — is a
 *        confident lie here: reloading changes nothing, and the person reading
 *        it has already been charged. It is the one refusal on this route the
 *        buyer cannot clear by any action at all, so the copy says what
 *        happened to their money instead of asking them to retry.
 *   410  the competition itself is over — completed, archived, or more than the
 *        grace week past its end date — so the pass would apply to nothing
 *        (v17 gap #353). Split out of the 4xx bucket for the same reason 409 is,
 *        and it is worth being precise about how it differs from `stale`: a
 *        stale page is a page RELOADING fixes, and reloading fixes nothing here.
 *        On the recoverable arm the remedy is off this page entirely — move the
 *        competition's end date, or reopen it — and on the terminal arm there is
 *        no remedy at all, because a pass cannot be bought twice for one
 *        competition (#248 Q4) and this one was never bought once. So the copy
 *        states the fact rather than issuing an instruction that cannot work.
 *   503  the only thing this route 503s for is a rung whose one-time price has
 *        not been `stripe:sync`'d in this environment. Unambiguous as a CAUSE,
 *        so the copy names the rung — but it says "try the other size" rather
 *        than "pick the other size", because an environment that has never been
 *        synced at all has both rungs in this state and the second one would be
 *        a second dead end.
 *   4xx  every other refusal — already holds a pass, plan now covers it, no
 *        active org, signed out, competition gone, rung not in `PASS_KEYS`.
 *        They differ in cause and NOT in remedy: each means the page was
 *        rendered against state that has since moved, and each is resolved by
 *        reloading. Telling all of them "that size isn't one we sell" would be
 *        a confident lie in five cases out of six.
 *   else 5xx, a rejected fetch, an ok body with no secret. Nothing is known;
 *        say so, and invite a retry.
