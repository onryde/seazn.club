//
// Sibling of `plan-copy-truth.test.ts`, which points the same pure functions in
// `@/lib/copy-truth` at `stripe-plans.json`. Split rather than extended because
// the two surfaces need different scoping — a seed description is one product's
// claim, an article is a page of mixed claims about four plans — and because
// that file's own header says it is the application to the seed.
//
// LOCATION IS LOAD-BEARING: `src/lib/__tests__/`. CI's unit job has no
// DATABASE_URL and its Postgres steps select `src/server src/lib` and `src/app`

 * Articles this task fixed, and therefore scans.

 * NOT a directory walk. Two siblings this task fixed were `billing/downgrade.md`
 * (the same unqualified fee-reversion claim these guards ban — see the new
 * describe block below, `billing/downgrade.md is gated too`) and
 * `scheduling/ai-scheduling.md` (the retired per-division run-cap table AND the
 * false "officials AI runs are not metered" claim — see
 * `scheduling/ai-scheduling.md is gated too`, further down). Both moved out of
 * this list and into real scans once #303 corrected the copy. What remains
 * below is a real gap with a real issue, and listing it as data rather than
 * leaving it silently unscanned is the point.
 *
 * #365: `scheduling/ai-officials.md` was the THIRD copy of #303's unmetered-run
 * falsehood, plus its own "Automatic officials assignment is a Pro Plus
 * feature" — untouched because #303's guard was only ever invoked on
 * `ai-scheduling.md` by name. Fixed here (see `scheduling/ai-officials.md is
 * gated too`, further down) and the unmetered-run guard is now run over EVERY
 * article in the tree (see `no help article anywhere claims an AI run is
 * unmetered/free`, further down) rather than added as a fourth named file — so
 * a fourth copy reds this suite instead of waiting for someone to notice.

Needs a rehype step or a wrapper element (#303)",
  "app/globals.css .competition-prose table — `display: block` is what gives that scroll box its overflow, and it drops the implicit table role in some assistive tech (row/column relationships stop being announced).

  "THE AXIS IS CIRCULAR. `claiming` is computed by running `en.halfClaim` over the tree, so an article only joins the half-rate axis — and therefore only earns a gate — if that vocabulary already matches it. The vocabulary has been measured at 0/12 and 0/24, so an article stating the rate in an unseen shape is invisible to the axis AND ungated. The axis narrows the ungated set; it does not close it (#303)",
  "THE FOURTH ARTICLE. `billing/plans.md` states the plan org caps and the fee ladder and is inventory-gated. `billing/downgrade.md`, `scheduling/ai-scheduling.md` and `scheduling/ai-officials.md` now carry the fee-lock/run-cap/unmetered-run vocabulary scans (below), which is real coverage but NOT the word-for-word inventory gate — a reword that stays inside the vocabulary's blind spots is still possible. `billing/credits.md`, `billing/operator.md` and every other non-billing, non-scheduling article remain fully ungated and unscanned, defended only by the vocabulary above (#303, #365)",
  "COMMENTS OWNED BY A CLOSING TOKEN SURVIVE `codeOnly` — NOT just the JSX idiom. `forEachChild` never visits TOKENS, so any comment whose nearest owner is a closing token is never blanked: `{/* … */}`, but equally an end-of-block comment on its own line, a comment in an empty block, the last call argument, the last array element, the last object property, the end of an interface body, a `switch`, or an `if`. Only an end-of-file comment is blanked. Measured tree-wide: 569 comment lines / 32,229 chars across 168 of 1,460 files. Direction is FAIL-SAFE — a negative scan can red on a comment that mentions a banned idiom, but can never miss real code — which is why it is recorded rather than fixed. Recorded as .tsx-only in round 5; that scoping was wrong and would have left the next reader hunting a JSX bug (#338)",
  "LITERAL-FREE SPANS ARE UNAUDITED, AND THIS ONE IS FAIL-OPEN. `blankedInsideLiteralFaults` proves every changed character lies OUTSIDE every string/regex/template-part/JSX literal, which closes the historical family (a `/*` inside a string ate 193 lines of division-settings.tsx) — proven by a length-preserving blank across every file raising 14,857 faults. It does NOT audit a stripper that eats a span containing NO literal at all. Constructed and it PASSES: blanking the largest literal-free span per file ships 79/79 green while destroying 1,061,443 chars across 1,341 of 1,460 files, largest single span 11,831 chars in server/usecases/billing-events.ts — LARGER than the 11,384 the historical bug actually ate. So this is not a corner case, it is most of the tree. THE COST ESTIMATE IN THE TASK 7 REPORT IS WRONG and that is the part that matters: closing this does NOT need a re-parse-and-compare 'doubling the walk'. It is a string check on the CHANGED CHARACTERS ONLY — take each maximal run of changed offsets, extend across neighbouring changed/space chars, require that span's raw text to be comments and whitespace only. O(changed chars), no re-parse, sub-millisecond per file. A wrong cost estimate is what stops a thing ever being closed (#338)",
  "FRONTMATTER PARSER DIVERGENCE, STILL LIVE. `server/help-content.ts`'s parseFrontmatter splits on `indexOf(\":\")` and is last-wins, so an indented `  description:` or a spaced `description :` is still RENDERED as the article's description while `copy-truth.ts`'s claimSurfaces regex (`^([A-Za-z_][\\w-]*):`) does not match it — the field scores 0 gate faults and is invisible to every rule. A falsehood delivered that way ships green (#303)",

// TASK 7 — `content/help/billing/add-ons.md`, the article the shipped
// `billing.addons.extra-org` tip used to point around.
//
// It is GATED FROM DAY ONE rather than after it has carried a falsehood. See
// APPROVED_ADD_ONS_INVENTORY's header for the argument; the short version is
// that every paragraph of it is about money an organiser is charged, and it
// makes the very rate claim this wave has spent three rounds correcting.
//
// The only LEXICAL rule pointed at it is the half-rate one, reused whole from
// the dictionary guards — no new pattern is added anywhere for this article.
// That is deliberate: this wave's measured lesson is that a rule which reads
// the sentence scores on its author's imagination (1/12, 0/12, 6/30, 0/32,
// 1/40), so the answer to "cover a new page" is a pinned inventory, not another
// vocabulary. The pass-duration and fee-rate allowlists are deliberately NOT
// pointed here either: "the credits themselves never expire" is TRUE of a
// credit pack, and a guard that reds on true prose teaches the next editor to
// route around it.

/**
 * ── NO HELP ARTICLE SELLS SCORING DETAIL (entitlements v18 / W1) ─────────────
 *
 * V390 deleted the three fidelity feature keys from `plan_entitlements` and the
 * same wave deleted their gate from `scoreEvent` and the batch importer. Every
 * band of recording detail is free on every plan, and the pad's Recording chip
 * is a picker with no lock, no plan name and nothing to unlock.
 *
 * TREE-WIDE for the reason `unmeteredFaultsAcrossTree` above is: the brief for
 * this task named six articles and MISSED four — `scoring/fidelity.md`,
 * `scoring/badminton.md`, `scoring/tabletennis.md` and `scoring/volleyball.md`
 * — each of which told a reader in as many words that the finest level "needs a
 * plan that includes it". A guard scoped to a filename list would have shipped
 * all four. This one reds wherever the sentence lands, including in an article
 * nobody has written yet.
 *
 * SENTENCE-scoped, not article-scoped: `billing/plans.md` names every plan we
 * sell and `scoring/cricket.md` explains ball-by-ball scoring at length. Both
 * are true; only the two claims INSIDE ONE SENTENCE assert a price.
