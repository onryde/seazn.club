// v17 Task 6 (re-review, CRITICAL cadence fix): the daily cron entry point
// (api/cron/billing-grant) that grants every LIVE wallet its
// ai.credits.monthly(plan) * quantity_paid allowance — scaled for paid plans,
// flat for community (SPEC-2 §11.2); a TRIALING paid wallet scales by
// max(quantity_paid, live_org_count) instead (#291, see
// grantMonthlyForAllWallets' docstring). Each grant first expires any unspent
// grant-bucket leftover from the prior period (D1, use-or-lose, Task 6 review
// fix) before adding the new allowance. Idempotent per period: EVERY wallet —
// paid or Community — keys its period off the plain calendar month
// (`YYYY-MM`, server clock; README §7 item 7's anchor). This is deliberately
// NOT the Stripe billing-cycle boundary (`current_period_end`): SPEC-2 §5.4
// Cadence requires the grant to be monthly *regardless of billing cadence* —
// an annual Pro ($159/yr) still gets 60/mo × 12, not a 720 lump — and an
// annual subscription's `current_period_end` only advances once a year, so
// anchoring on it (a prior version of this cron did, for paid wallets) is a
// cadence regression, not an approximation.
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL.
