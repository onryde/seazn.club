// An Event Pass under a PAID plan (v17 gap #327/#337).
//
// Until V344 the resolver stopped consulting the pass the moment the resolved
// plan was paid, on the premise that Pro was a strict superset of any pass. The
// L rung (#294) ended that: `entrants.per_division.max` is 256 on Pro and
// UNLIMITED on L. So an organiser who bought L for a competition and then
// subscribed to Pro silently lost unlimited entrants on the competition they
// had already paid to unlock — a PAID action that took something away.
//
// What ships instead is the BETTER of the two, per axis. This suite pins all
// four directions of that, because getting any one of them backwards is a
// money-facing bug:
//
//   * pass better  → pass wins   (entrants: L unlimited vs Pro 256)
//   * plan better  → plan wins   (divisions: Pro unlimited vs L's 20)
//   * lower better → smaller wins (registration.fee_percent: Pro 2% vs pass 5%)
//   * pass says false → plan's true survives (the pass never revokes)
//
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL.
