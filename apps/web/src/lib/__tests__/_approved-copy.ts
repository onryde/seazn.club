// THE APPROVED WORDING of the billing-help copy that keeps regressing —
// every surface of it, not only its paragraphs.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Three consecutive rounds of the v17 truth-in-copy wave shipped or preserved a
// falsehood in this copy, and each round was caught by a person reading
// the copy against the code — never by a rule. The rules were all denylists
// (banned phrasings, banned vocabularies, banned "grammatical forms"), and a
// denylist can only contain what its author thought of. Measured, each time by
// someone other than the author: 1/12, then 0/12.
//
// This file is the other half of the answer. It does not generalise, so there is
// no phrasing that evades it: the surface either says the approved words or it
// does not.
//
// ── IF A TEST SENT YOU HERE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The test is a GATE, not a bug. You changed one of these surfaces — a
// paragraph, a heading, a list item, a table row or a frontmatter field — and the
// change needs one deliberate step before it ships:
//
//   1. Read your new wording against the code it describes — the source of truth
//      is named in each entry's `why`, and it is a file path, not a memory.
//   2. Paste the failing test's "on disk:" string into that entry's `text`.
//   3. Say in the commit message what changed and what you checked it against.
//
// That is the step that was skipped three times. It costs a few minutes; the
// falsehoods it is meant to catch have each been about money an organiser is
// charged.
//
// The digests here are taken over NORMALISED text — `claimSurfaces` output, so
// markdown emphasis and link syntax are already stripped, headings are their
// text, and a frontmatter field is "<key>: <value>". Copy the digest the failure
// prints rather than recomputing one by hand.

If the competition had already taken a paid card entry before the pass was bought, it stays on the rate it locked in then — buying a pass does not lower an already-locked rate, so buy before you open entries, not after.

  "d3494f085c5710ec",
  // Approved 2026-07-29 (v17 gap #353). ONE new paragraph, inserted here: "The
  // same line decides when a pass can be BOUGHT. You can buy a pass while its
  // competition is still running, or during the 7-day grace after its end date;
  // once a competition has passed that line the purchase is refused rather than
  // sold, so you can never pay for a pass that would apply to nothing."
  //
  // Read against the code before recording, per this file's own rule. The claim
  // is "the buy window is the same window as the apply window", and the code it
  // describes is `lib/entitlements.ts`'s `passLockReason` — status in
  // {completed, archived}, or ends_on + PASS_END_GRACE_DAYS (7) < today (UTC) —
  // which is now what `api/billing/pass-checkout/route.ts` gates the purchase
  // on, and what `pass_applies` (V343) gates the billing page's offer list on.
  // So the two windows are literally the same predicate, and "7 days" is that
  // constant rather than a number written down twice. "Refused rather than sold"
  // is the 410, which is raised BEFORE any Stripe session is created — no money
  // moves, which is the part of the sentence a reader is relying on.
  "3b3bc011debe7da5",
  "9a68888ef2d9aa1a",
  // Approved 2026-08-05 (#376). ONE new section — a heading and six paragraphs,
  // inserted here: "When a competition closes to new passes". The claim is that
  // the line which stops a pass APPLYING is also the line which stops one being
  // SOLD, that it is a property of the competition rather than of a purchase,
  // and that the offer is now withdrawn rather than left on screen in front of a
  // checkout that refuses.
  //
  // Read against the code before recording, per this file's own rule:
  //   - the two reasons and the 7-day grace are `lib/entitlements.ts`
  //     `passLockReason` / `PASS_END_GRACE_DAYS`, unchanged by #376 — the same
  //     predicate the SQL `pass_applies` (V343) uses, which is why the section
  //     says "that same line" rather than writing a second rule down.
  //   - "not offered anywhere", four places: the chip on
  //     `c/[compSlug]/page.tsx` and `c/[compSlug]/settings/page.tsx` (both
  //     render `competition-pass-entry.tsx`, which returns the closed link
  //     instead of the buy pill once `usePassGateState()` is "closed"), the ⋯
  //     menu on `o/[orgSlug]/page.tsx:235` (`!isPassLocked(...)`), and the
  //     billing page's offer list (`pass_applies`, V343).
  //   - "This competition is closed to Event Passes" is the literal
  //     `upgrade.closed.title` string, rendered by `ClosedPanel` in
  //     `c/[compSlug]/upgrade/page.tsx`; the two next steps, and which reason
  //     gets which, are its `Record<PassLockReason, …>` — `terminal` →
  //     `routes.competitionNew`, `past_ends_on` → `routes.competitionSettings`.
  //     Both links are gated on the viewer being able to act, which is why the
  //     copy says only an editor sees one.
  //   - "the checkout behind it refused the sale" is the 410 in
  //     `api/billing/pass-checkout/route.ts:185` — still the server's answer,
  //     and the defect #376 was filed about was that the offer did not agree
  //     with it.
  //   - "correcting either one puts the offer back" is compute-at-read: no
  //     column stores the verdict (`passLockReason`'s own doc comment), which
  //     is the same property `lib/competition-wrapup.ts`'s header gives as the
  //     reason the product PROMPTS for a wrap-up rather than sweeping a status.
  //   - the paid-plan paragraph is `upgrade-page-state.ts`'s paid arm, where
  //     #376 added `closedToPasses === null` to the #327 exceeding-rung offer —
  //     so the L offer a Pro org sometimes gets is withdrawn past the line too.
  //   - the "already bought" paragraph deliberately does NOT say a held pass is
  //     unaffected by the line. `usePassGateState` resolves "ended", not
  //     "held", once `lockReason` is set, and the resolver has already stopped
  //     honouring the row (SPEC-4 §7); the OFFER side is all #376 changed, and
  //     the two sections above this one already state the applying side.

/**
 * The WHOLE of `content/help/billing/add-ons.md` (v17 gap wave 7, task 7, #299).
 *
 * WHY A BRAND-NEW ARTICLE IS GATED FROM DAY ONE, rather than after it has
 * carried a falsehood the way the two above did. Everything on this page is a
 * statement about money an organiser is charged — what each add-on costs, on
 * what cadence, who may buy it, and what happens when it stops — and it makes
 * the rate claim (`no more than half the base rate`) that this wave has now
 * spent four rounds correcting on other surfaces. The two articles above were
 * pinned only after a lexical rule was measured at 1/12, 0/12, 6/30 and 1/40
 * against sets their own authors had not written; there is no reason to repeat
 * that experiment on a page whose claims are the same shape.
 *
 * ── A GATE PROVES DELIBERATE, NEVER TRUE ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Round 1 of this article was inventory-approved and shipped THREE false money
 * claims, and the `why` notes below named the very files that contradicted
 * them. That is not a defect in the gate; it is the gate's contract. Approving
 * a digest records that somebody chose these words — it cannot record that they
 * checked them. So each bullet below now states WHAT IS ASSERTED, in the words
 * the article uses, next to the code that decides it. Re-approving means
 * reading the file and confirming the assertion still holds, not re-recording
 * a hash.
 *
 * WHAT THE ARTICLE ASSERTS, AND WHAT DECIDES IT:
 *
 *  - "the credits themselves never expire", one-time, whole-wallet.
 *    `config/stripe-plans.json` `packs[]` (no `interval`), and
 *    `lib/entitlements.ts` `addonBonusForWallet` keying the sum on
 *    `coalesce(group_subscription_id, org_id)`.
 *
 *  - "raises ONE organisation's member limit by one", monthly, payer-only, and
 *    "added to your next invoice rather than charged on the spot".
 *    `server/usecases/extra-seats.ts` — `requireBillingOwner` (payer gate), a
 *    subscription ITEM on the group's existing subscription (`:79`), and
 *    `proration_behavior: "create_prorations"` on create/raise (`:75`, `:83`)
 *    against `"none"` on removal (`:64`). ROUND 1 SAID "charged pro rata
 *    straight away" AND WAS WRONG: `create_prorations` books the adjustment
 *    onto the NEXT INVOICE rather than charging immediately — stated in
 *    `server/usecases/billing-events.ts:738-740`, and the product's own UI copy
 *    already had it right (`en/ui.json` `addOns.extraOrg.prorateUp`, which
 *    deliberately does not say "now").
 *
 *  - "raises ONE competition's limit by 32", permanent, stacking, owner-gated,
 *    "never lifts an organisation-wide limit".
 *    `server/usecases/size-pack-checkout.ts` (owner-of-the-competition's-org
 *    gate; the group card only when that owner IS the payer; a 30s idempotency
 *    bucket that does NOT block a genuine second pack) and
 *    `stripe-plans.json` `size_packs[0]`. The scope claim is
 *    `addonBonusForWallet`'s `target_competition_id` predicate: a comp-scoped
 *    row cannot match an org-level cap read.
 *
 *  - "Pro covers 5 and Pro Plus covers 10" — `plan_entitlements.orgs.max_owned`,
 *    set by V314. Asserted against the LIVE matrix, not restated here.
 *
 *  - "no more than half the base rate" for a slot INSIDE the plan, and "on a
 *    monthly bill it matches that half rate exactly, and on an annual bill it
 *    does not … about a third more over a year".
 *    `lib/org-addons.ts:95-107` names this exact trap: the rider is a MONTHLY
 *    price on every plan, so an annual Pro group pays 900/month (~10800/year)
 *    for a rider against 7900/year for an in-plan slot. Measured from the seed:
 *    Pro $108/yr vs $79/yr (+36.7%), Pro Plus $228/yr vs $163/yr (+39.9%).
 *    ROUND 1 SAID "charged at exactly that same rate" AND WAS WRONG — an
 *    unqualified comparative price claim one clause after the one it had just
 *    qualified.
 *
 *  - "An extra seat stops you adding members, and makes the ones over the
 *    limit read-only … owners never are."
 *    `frozenMemberIds` (`entitlement-freeze.ts:103`) reads
 *    `getLimit(orgId, "members.max")`, which SUMS the add-on bonus, and exempts
 *    owners explicitly. ROUND 2 SAID "re-checked on every write" AND OVERSTATED
 *    IT: `assertMemberNotFrozen` has exactly ONE production call site,
 *    `server/api-v1/auth.ts:213-214`, gated on `via: session` AND
 *    `scope === "write"` AND `role === "admin"` — a bearer token returns from
 *    `apiKeyAuth` first, so API-KEY writes are never freeze-checked. What IS
 *    enforced everywhere is ADMISSION: `lib/invites.ts:72-79` and
 *    `app/api/orgs/[id]/members/[userId]/role/route.ts:47-54` both count the
 *    quota and throw `PaymentRequiredError` inside the same transaction as the
 *    write. (Both were previously cited at the line that merely RESOLVES the
 *    quota key, six and twenty-five lines earlier respectively — and the
 *    route's own comment on that line says "before the tx", the opposite of
 *    what it was cited for.)
 *
 *    ROUND 3'S REPLACEMENT WAS ALSO WRONG about the surface: it said "enforced
 *    on our public API today", but on that API the normal caller is a bearer
 *    `sc_` key and `server/api-v1/auth.ts:204` (`if (token) return apiKeyAuth(...)`) returns
 *    BEFORE the check — so API-key clients are not checked either. (Cited as
 *    `server/api-v1/auth.ts:210` for two rounds; :210 is a comment.)
 *
 *    AND ROUND 3'S OTHER HALF WAS FALSE OUTRIGHT. It said the freeze reaches
 *    "not the app's own screens". `lib/client-v1.ts:23-27` sends only
 *    `Content-Type` — no `Authorization` — so an in-app component hitting
 *    `/api/v1/orgs/**` takes the SESSION branch of `requireOrgAuth` and IS
 *    freeze-checked. Five screens write through it: `components/api-keys.tsx`
 *    (Settings → API), `components/news/composer.tsx`,
 *    `components/org-sponsors.tsx`, `components/sponsor-packages.tsx` and
 *    `components/org-payment-instructions.tsx`. An admin over `members.max`
 *    would have read this article, been told the app was exempt, and then hit a
 *    402 in Settings → API and the news composer.
 *
 *    THE GUARD PINNED THAT FALSEHOOD, and the reason generalises: it counted
 *    the 13 `app/api/v1/**` routes reaching `requireOrgAuth` and never asked
 *    WHO CALLS THEM. Counting a surface proves its SIZE, never its REACH. It
 *    now discovers the in-app callers, requires each to be declared with the
 *    surface name the copy uses, requires the copy to name every one, and
 *    asserts no caller sends an `Authorization` header — which is the fact that
 *    makes them session-authenticated and therefore freeze-checked.
 *
 *  - "An extra organisation does not freeze anything … what it loses is the
 *    ability to add another."
 *    `orgs.max_owned` IS NOT A FREEZE AXIS. `entitlement-freeze.ts` freezes
 *    exactly two things — `competitions.max_active` (`:64`) and `members.max`
 *    (`:104`) — and `lib/billing-group.ts:411-414` states the cap is
 *    ADMISSION-ONLY: `assertWithinGroupCap` checks `count + 1 > limit` on the
 *    way IN and "is never re-evaluated against organisations that already
 *    exist". ROUND 1 CLAIMED THE EXCESS FREEZES AND WAS WRONG. The companion
 *    claim — that you cannot cancel your way over the line — is the 423 usage
 *    floor in `server/usecases/extra-orgs.ts:144-166`.
 *
 *  - "nothing is deleted" — `lib/entitlements.ts` `COUNTING_ADDON_STATUSES`:
 *    'canceled' is frozen-not-deleted (V323).
 *
 * NOT PINNED BY THIS INVENTORY, and therefore free to rot: link TARGETS.
 * `claimSurfaces` reduces `[text](/url)` to `text`, so repointing a `mailto:`
 * or a help URL raises zero faults here. (Distinct from the link-TITLE hole,
 * filed as #338.)

/**
 * The WHOLE of `content/help/billing/groups.md` (v17 gap wave 7, task 7, round 3).
 *
 * GATED BECAUSE THE VOCABULARY WAS MEASURED AT 0/24 ON IT. Off-vocabulary false
 * rate claims pasted into this file — "costs 50% of the base rate", "half as
 * much as the first", "half of what the plan costs", plus native es/fr/nl —
 * shipped 119/119 green, as did an entire new help article. The same edit to
 * the gated `add-ons.md` redded immediately.
 *
 * That number also bears on the computed half-rate axis in
 * `help-copy-truth.test.ts`: the axis is computed THROUGH `en.halfClaim`, so
 * membership was being decided by a regex that catches almost nothing. Gating
 * the two articles on the axis is what makes the axis mean something.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ARTICLE ASSERTS, AND WHAT DECIDES IT:
 *  - the extra-organisation rate, five times — `stripe-plans.json`'s graduated
 *    tiers via `riderClaimShape`; only "no more than half" is true in all
 *    twenty plan x interval x currency combinations.
 *  - WHEN THE ATTACH CHARGE LANDS. `attachOrgToGroup` bills entirely through
 *    `syncGroupQuantity`, whose only Stripe mutation is
 *    `subscriptions.update` with `create_prorations`
 *    (`billing-groups.ts:327-330`) — the NEXT invoice, not the card, and the
 *    same behaviour the add-on paths have. Round 2 said "charged now" on six
 *    surfaces here on the strength of a stale comment.
 *  - the dunning window — real, but it is the next INVOICE that can fail;
 *    nothing is attempted against the card at attach.
 *  - "Removing never refunds, and adding never takes money from your card there
 *    and then" (`## No refunds, and the freed slot`). ROUND 5: this said
 *    "adding ALWAYS CHARGES IMMEDIATELY", false three ways — prorations book to
 *    the next invoice (`billing-groups.ts:327-330`), a freed-slot attach raises
 *    no proration at all (`previewAttachCharge:122`, `raising` requires
 *    `active > quantity_paid`), and a trial attach charges nothing (`:123`,
 *    `:320`). It also contradicted line 41 of this same article, which round 3
 *    had corrected.
 *
 *    THE GATE FROZE IT FAITHFULLY FOR TWO ROUNDS. That is not a failure of the
 *    gate; it is the gate's contract, and this wave's thesis in one line: an
 *    inventory proves a wording was DELIBERATE, never that it was TRUE. Only
 *    reading the sentence against `billing-groups.ts` found it, which is the
 *    step the fixture exists to force and which nobody had performed on this
 *    paragraph.
 *  - the freed slot, the fee lock, payouts, the detach modes — see the
 *    per-section notes in `server/usecases/billing-groups.ts`.
