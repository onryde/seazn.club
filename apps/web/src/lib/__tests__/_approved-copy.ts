// THE APPROVED WORDING of the billing-help copy that keeps regressing —
// every surface of it, not only its paragraphs.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Three consecutive rounds of the v17 truth-in-copy wave shipped or preserved a
// falsehood in this copy, and each round was caught by a person reading
// the copy against the code — never by a rule. The rules were all denylists
// (banned phrasings, banned vocabularies, banned "grammatical forms"), and a
// denylist can only contain what its author thought of. Measured, each time by
// someone other than the author: 1/12, then 0/12.
//
// This file is the other half of the answer. It does not generalise, so there is
// no phrasing that evades it: the surface either says the approved words or it
// does not.
//
// ── IF A TEST SENT YOU HERE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The test is a GATE, not a bug. You changed one of these surfaces — a
// paragraph, a heading, a list item, a table row or a frontmatter field — and the
// change needs one deliberate step before it ships:
//
//   1. Read your new wording against the code it describes — the source of truth
//      is named in each entry's `why`, and it is a file path, not a memory.
//   2. Paste the failing test's "on disk:" string into that entry's `text`.
//   3. Say in the commit message what changed and what you checked it against.
//
// That is the step that was skipped three times. It costs a few minutes; the
// falsehoods it is meant to catch have each been about money an organiser is
// charged.
//
// The digests here are taken over NORMALISED text — `claimSurfaces` output, so
// markdown emphasis and link syntax are already stripped, headings are their
// text, and a frontmatter field is "<key>: <value>". Copy the digest the failure
// prints rather than recomputing one by hand.

If the competition had already taken a paid card entry before the pass was bought, it stays on the rate it locked in then — buying a pass does not lower an already-locked rate, so buy before you open entries, not after.

/**
 * The WHOLE of `content/help/billing/add-ons.md` (v17 gap wave 7, task 7, #299).
 *
 * WHY A BRAND-NEW ARTICLE IS GATED FROM DAY ONE, rather than after it has
 * carried a falsehood the way the two above did. Everything on this page is a
 * statement about money an organiser is charged — what each add-on costs, on
 * what cadence, who may buy it, and what happens when it stops — and it makes
 * the rate claim (`no more than half the base rate`) that this wave has now
 * spent four rounds correcting on other surfaces. The two articles above were
 * pinned only after a lexical rule was measured at 1/12, 0/12, 6/30 and 1/40
 * against sets their own authors had not written; there is no reason to repeat
 * that experiment on a page whose claims are the same shape.
 *
 * ── A GATE PROVES DELIBERATE, NEVER TRUE ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Round 1 of this article was inventory-approved and shipped THREE false money
 * claims, and the `why` notes below named the very files that contradicted
 * them. That is not a defect in the gate; it is the gate's contract. Approving
 * a digest records that somebody chose these words — it cannot record that they
 * checked them. So each bullet below now states WHAT IS ASSERTED, in the words
 * the article uses, next to the code that decides it. Re-approving means
 * reading the file and confirming the assertion still holds, not re-recording
 * a hash.
 *
 * WHAT THE ARTICLE ASSERTS, AND WHAT DECIDES IT:
 *
 *  - "the credits themselves never expire", one-time, whole-wallet.
 *    `config/stripe-plans.json` `packs[]` (no `interval`), and
 *    `lib/entitlements.ts` `addonBonusForWallet` keying the sum on
 *    `coalesce(group_subscription_id, org_id)`.
 *
 *  - "raises ONE organisation's member limit by one", monthly, payer-only, and
 *    "added to your next invoice rather than charged on the spot".
 *    `server/usecases/extra-seats.ts` — `requireBillingOwner` (payer gate), a
 *    subscription ITEM on the group's existing subscription (`:79`), and
 *    `proration_behavior: "create_prorations"` on create/raise (`:75`, `:83`)
 *    against `"none"` on removal (`:64`). ROUND 1 SAID "charged pro rata
 *    straight away" AND WAS WRONG: `create_prorations` books the adjustment
 *    onto the NEXT INVOICE rather than charging immediately — stated in
 *    `server/usecases/billing-events.ts:738-740`, and the product's own UI copy
 *    already had it right (`en/ui.json` `addOns.extraOrg.prorateUp`, which
 *    deliberately does not say "now").
 *
 *  - "raises ONE competition's limit by 32", permanent, stacking, owner-gated,
 *    "never lifts an organisation-wide limit".
 *    `server/usecases/size-pack-checkout.ts` (owner-of-the-competition's-org
 *    gate; the group card only when that owner IS the payer; a 30s idempotency
 *    bucket that does NOT block a genuine second pack) and
 *    `stripe-plans.json` `size_packs[0]`. The scope claim is
 *    `addonBonusForWallet`'s `target_competition_id` predicate: a comp-scoped
 *    row cannot match an org-level cap read.
 *
 *  - "Pro covers 5 and Pro Plus covers 10" — `plan_entitlements.orgs.max_owned`,
 *    set by V314. Asserted against the LIVE matrix, not restated here.
 *
 *  - "no more than half the base rate" for a slot INSIDE the plan, and "on a
 *    monthly bill it matches that half rate exactly, and on an annual bill it
 *    does not … about a third more over a year".
 *    `lib/org-addons.ts:95-107` names this exact trap: the rider is a MONTHLY
 *    price on every plan, so an annual Pro group pays 900/month (~10800/year)
 *    for a rider against 7900/year for an in-plan slot. Measured from the seed:
 *    Pro $108/yr vs $79/yr (+36.7%), Pro Plus $228/yr vs $163/yr (+39.9%).
 *    ROUND 1 SAID "charged at exactly that same rate" AND WAS WRONG — an
 *    unqualified comparative price claim one clause after the one it had just
 *    qualified.
 *
 *  - "An extra seat stops you adding members, and makes the ones over the
 *    limit read-only … owners never are."
 *    `frozenMemberIds` (`entitlement-freeze.ts:103`) reads
 *    `getLimit(orgId, "members.max")`, which SUMS the add-on bonus, and exempts
 *    owners explicitly. ROUND 2 SAID "re-checked on every write" AND OVERSTATED
 *    IT: `assertMemberNotFrozen` has exactly ONE production call site,
 *    `server/api-v1/auth.ts:213-214`, gated on `via: session` AND
 *    `scope === "write"` AND `role === "admin"` — a bearer token returns from
 *    `apiKeyAuth` first, so API-KEY writes are never freeze-checked. What IS
 *    enforced everywhere is ADMISSION: `lib/invites.ts:72-79` and
 *    `app/api/orgs/[id]/members/[userId]/role/route.ts:47-54` both count the
 *    quota and throw `PaymentRequiredError` inside the same transaction as the
 *    write. (Both were previously cited at the line that merely RESOLVES the
 *    quota key, six and twenty-five lines earlier respectively — and the
 *    route's own comment on that line says "before the tx", the opposite of
 *    what it was cited for.)
 *
 *    ROUND 3'S REPLACEMENT WAS ALSO WRONG about the surface: it said "enforced
 *    on our public API today", but on that API the normal caller is a bearer
 *    `sc_` key and `server/api-v1/auth.ts:204` (`if (token) return apiKeyAuth(...)`) returns
 *    BEFORE the check — so API-key clients are not checked either. (Cited as
 *    `server/api-v1/auth.ts:210` for two rounds; :210 is a comment.)
 *
 *    AND ROUND 3'S OTHER HALF WAS FALSE OUTRIGHT. It said the freeze reaches
 *    "not the app's own screens". `lib/client-v1.ts:23-27` sends only
 *    `Content-Type` — no `Authorization` — so an in-app component hitting
 *    `/api/v1/orgs/**` takes the SESSION branch of `requireOrgAuth` and IS
 *    freeze-checked. Five screens write through it: `components/api-keys.tsx`
 *    (Settings → API), `components/news/composer.tsx`,
 *    `components/org-sponsors.tsx`, `components/sponsor-packages.tsx` and
 *    `components/org-payment-instructions.tsx`. An admin over `members.max`
 *    would have read this article, been told the app was exempt, and then hit a
 *    402 in Settings → API and the news composer.
 *
 *    THE GUARD PINNED THAT FALSEHOOD, and the reason generalises: it counted
 *    the 13 `app/api/v1/**` routes reaching `requireOrgAuth` and never asked
 *    WHO CALLS THEM. Counting a surface proves its SIZE, never its REACH. It
 *    now discovers the in-app callers, requires each to be declared with the
 *    surface name the copy uses, requires the copy to name every one, and
 *    asserts no caller sends an `Authorization` header — which is the fact that
 *    makes them session-authenticated and therefore freeze-checked.
 *
 *  - "An extra organisation does not freeze anything … what it loses is the
 *    ability to add another."
 *    `orgs.max_owned` IS NOT A FREEZE AXIS. `entitlement-freeze.ts` freezes
 *    exactly two things — `competitions.max_active` (`:64`) and `members.max`
 *    (`:104`) — and `lib/billing-group.ts:411-414` states the cap is
 *    ADMISSION-ONLY: `assertWithinGroupCap` checks `count + 1 > limit` on the
 *    way IN and "is never re-evaluated against organisations that already
 *    exist". ROUND 1 CLAIMED THE EXCESS FREEZES AND WAS WRONG. The companion
 *    claim — that you cannot cancel your way over the line — is the 423 usage
 *    floor in `server/usecases/extra-orgs.ts:144-166`.
 *
 *  - "nothing is deleted" — `lib/entitlements.ts` `COUNTING_ADDON_STATUSES`:
 *    'canceled' is frozen-not-deleted (V323).
 *
 * NOT PINNED BY THIS INVENTORY, and therefore free to rot: link TARGETS.
 * `claimSurfaces` reduces `[text](/url)` to `text`, so repointing a `mailto:`
 * or a help URL raises zero faults here. (Distinct from the link-TITLE hole,
 * filed as #338.)

/**
 * The WHOLE of `content/help/billing/groups.md` (v17 gap wave 7, task 7, round 3).
 *
 * GATED BECAUSE THE VOCABULARY WAS MEASURED AT 0/24 ON IT. Off-vocabulary false
 * rate claims pasted into this file — "costs 50% of the base rate", "half as
 * much as the first", "half of what the plan costs", plus native es/fr/nl —
 * shipped 119/119 green, as did an entire new help article. The same edit to
 * the gated `add-ons.md` redded immediately.
 *
 * That number also bears on the computed half-rate axis in
 * `help-copy-truth.test.ts`: the axis is computed THROUGH `en.halfClaim`, so
 * membership was being decided by a regex that catches almost nothing. Gating
 * the two articles on the axis is what makes the axis mean something.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ARTICLE ASSERTS, AND WHAT DECIDES IT:
 *  - the extra-organisation rate, five times — `stripe-plans.json`'s graduated
 *    tiers via `riderClaimShape`; only "no more than half" is true in all
 *    twenty plan x interval x currency combinations.
 *  - WHEN THE ATTACH CHARGE LANDS. `attachOrgToGroup` bills entirely through
 *    `syncGroupQuantity`, whose only Stripe mutation is
 *    `subscriptions.update` with `create_prorations`
 *    (`billing-groups.ts:327-330`) — the NEXT invoice, not the card, and the
 *    same behaviour the add-on paths have. Round 2 said "charged now" on six
 *    surfaces here on the strength of a stale comment.
 *  - the dunning window — real, but it is the next INVOICE that can fail;
 *    nothing is attempted against the card at attach.
 *  - "Removing never refunds, and adding never takes money from your card there
 *    and then" (`## No refunds, and the freed slot`). ROUND 5: this said
 *    "adding ALWAYS CHARGES IMMEDIATELY", false three ways — prorations book to
 *    the next invoice (`billing-groups.ts:327-330`), a freed-slot attach raises
 *    no proration at all (`previewAttachCharge:122`, `raising` requires
 *    `active > quantity_paid`), and a trial attach charges nothing (`:123`,
 *    `:320`). It also contradicted line 41 of this same article, which round 3
 *    had corrected.
 *
 *    THE GATE FROZE IT FAITHFULLY FOR TWO ROUNDS. That is not a failure of the
 *    gate; it is the gate's contract, and this wave's thesis in one line: an
 *    inventory proves a wording was DELIBERATE, never that it was TRUE. Only
 *    reading the sentence against `billing-groups.ts` found it, which is the
 *    step the fixture exists to force and which nobody had performed on this
 *    paragraph.
 *  - the freed slot, the fee lock, payouts, the detach modes — see the
 *    per-section notes in `server/usecases/billing-groups.ts`.

/**
 * The WHOLE of `content/help/getting-started/create-your-organisation.md`
 * (v17 gap wave 7, task 7, round 3).
 *
 * A file nothing in this wave had opened until the review found it stating the
 * extra-organisation rate at `:25`. Small, and gated for the same measured
 * reason as `groups.md`: it is a funnel page, it quotes the fee ladder and the
 * plan org caps, and the vocabulary that was supposedly defending it scored
 * 0/24.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS: the fee ladder (8/5/2/1, `plan_entitlements`
 * `registration.fee_percent`), the plan org caps (5 / 10, `orgs.max_owned`,
 * V314), the extra-organisation rate (`riderClaimShape`), and that Community
 * can already take card entry fees.
