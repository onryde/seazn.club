// #382 — division scheduling is open to every plan. V391 (entitlements v18)
// opened multi-division too, so no scheduling key is paid on any plan.
//
// `hasFeature` returns `row?.bool_value === true` (entitlements.ts), so a
// MISSING row is false. Event Pass carried no row at all for board, constraints
// or multi_division, which is why V353 INSERTS for it rather than flipping.
//
// Both resolution paths are exercised, because they are genuinely different
// reads and a matrix row can serve one and not the other:
//   - the org's own plan (`subscriptions.plan_key`), and
//   - a competition pass overlaid on a community org (`competition_passes`),
//     which is how an Event Pass is actually held in production.
//
// LOCATION IS LOAD-BEARING: `src/lib/__tests__/` — CI's Postgres job selects
// `src/server src/lib` and `src/app`; from elsewhere the whole
// `describe.skipIf(!HAS_DB)` body would run in no job at all and report green.
