// Source contract for the four public-surface `<img>` → `next/image`
// conversions (task-4-report.md §3, review finding 1). The repo deliberately
// has no component-render test machinery (no jsdom/RTL) — so this can't
// render the JSX and check what actually paints. Instead it locks the source
// text of each converted call site: still imports Image from "next/image",
// still carries the exact width/height pair it was converted with (dimension
// drift silently reintroduces CLS — next/image's whole point), and hasn't
// quietly reverted to a plain <img> for the same value. e2e owns visual
// verification; this test only guards against silent regression in source.
//
// Assertions are deliberately narrow per file (matched on the specific `src`
// identifier actually used at each converted site), not a file-wide `<img`
// ban — apps/web/src/app/(public)/shared/[orgSlug]/[competitionSlug]/page.tsx
// still has two *deliberate* `<img>` (competition branding.banner/logo,
// skipped as ambiguous-source per the report §4) that must keep working.
