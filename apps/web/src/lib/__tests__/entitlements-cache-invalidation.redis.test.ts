// v17 #287: lib/entitlements.ts caches resolved answers under
// `ent:<org>:<competition>:<feature>` for 300s (ENT_TTL_SECONDS). A
// competition write that moves status/ends_on — which the Event Pass lock
// (isPassLocked) reads live off the row on every resolve — must bust that
// cache in the SAME call, or a warm answer outlives the write for up to 5
// minutes. The bug is structurally invisible without a real Redis: with
// REDIS_URL unset, cacheGet always misses and every read hits Postgres
// fresh (lib/cache.ts), so this suite needs BOTH a real Postgres (usecase
// seeding) and a real Redis (an actually-warm cache to go stale). Skipped
// without either. CI runs this in its own step, mirroring
// rate-limit.redis.test.ts's REDIS_URL scoping (ci.yml).
