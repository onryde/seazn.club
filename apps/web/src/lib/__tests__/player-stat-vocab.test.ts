// Gap 1 — player-stat labels. The engine ships an English `label` on every
// declared metric, so the public player page and /me have never LOOKED broken:
// a French visitor sees "Goals", "Balls faced", "PIM" and nothing signals that
// copy is missing. That invisibility is the defect.
//
// Why these keys are per-sport (`stat.<sportKey>.<metricKey>`) and not flat:
// five metric keys are declared by more than one sport with DIFFERENT English
// wording — `sanctions` is "Sanctions" in volleyball and "Cards" in badminton,
// `points` is "Points won" in tennis, `so_*` are "GWS *" on ice and "SO *" on
// grass. A flat `stat.sanctions` would force one sport's word on another, in
// four languages, invisibly. `collidingMetricKeys()` below derives that set
// from the engine and pins that the dictionary keeps them distinct — so the
// justification for the scheme is itself a test, not a comment.
//
// Every expected set here is DERIVED from `builtinModules` at test time. A
// hand-copied list goes stale the moment a wave adds a metric (W4a added
// tennis `medical_timeouts`), which is exactly the failure this file closes.
