//
// Third sibling of `plan-copy-truth.test.ts` (the Stripe seed) and
// `help-copy-truth.test.ts` (the help tree). Same pure functions from
// `@/lib/copy-truth`, same "prove it by rewording" discipline — but this surface
// differs from both in the one way that matters:
//
//   THE SEED IS ONE ENGLISH FILE. THE HELP TREE IS ONE ENGLISH TREE.
//   THESE DICTIONARIES ARE FOUR FILES THAT ALL SAY THE SAME THING.
//
// Tasks 1-3 could point an English regex at their surface and be done. Doing
// that here certifies `en` and passes es/fr/nl in silence. Measured on the exact
// strings this task fixes, BEFORE the fix, with the shared
// `FALSE_PASS_PERMANENCE_PATTERNS`:
//
//   en pricing.pass.note  "Yours for the event's lifetime."        1 hit
//   es pricing.pass.note  "Tuyo durante toda la vida del evento."  0 hits
//   fr pricing.pass.note  "À vous pour toute la durée de …"        0 hits
//   nl pricing.pass.note  "…voor de hele levensduur van het …"     0 hits
//
// Four identical falsehoods, one red. So `LOCALE_CLAIMS` is keyed by locale,
// every vocabulary is cross-applied to every value, a retired-literal registry
// backs both up, and `localeCoverageFaults` makes an unguarded locale a FAULT.
// See the long header over that section in `@/lib/copy-truth` for why three
// layers rather than one.
//
// LOCATION IS LOAD-BEARING: `src/lib/__tests__/`. CI's unit job has no
// DATABASE_URL and its Postgres steps select `src/server src/lib` and `src/app`
// (.github/workflows/ci.yml). From `src/__tests__/` the `describe.skipIf(!HAS_DB)`
// half would run in no job at all and report pending on a green exit 0.

   * green, because "exempt" was the end of the conversation.

   * fix already prescribed for `FAQ_EXEMPT` on #338, applied here at the same
   * time so the two sides of this file do not drift apart again.
   *
   * Scoped to the claim families that are FALSE of the subjects on this page:
   * pass permanence and the bare half-rate. Community's "free forever" is TRUE,
   * so the permanence scan is pointed at values that mention the pass or an

   * prefix (`PRICING_KEY_DISPOSITION`). Neither reaches `ui.json`, and neither
   * reaches a `marketing.json` key outside the `pricing.` namespace — which is
   * everywhere else: 408 marketing keys and the whole of `ui.json` at the time

   * `upgrade.footnote` in all four locales, carrying "Your pass has no use-by
   * date and keeps working after the competition ends" (the exact reviewer
   * probe from #338), shipped 40/40 green before this test existed.
   *
   * The fix is not a hand-written classification of every key — that is a list,
   * and a list is the thing that must be remembered (the same lesson
   * `describedEntries` recorded for the Stripe seed). Instead this scans EVERY
   * value in BOTH dictionary files, in all four locales, with the SAME
   * clause-scoped vocabularies the exempt-key re-scan above already trusts, and
   * requires a hit to be on a PINNED key. A key nobody pinned that starts
   * making one of these claims is discovered the moment it does — no filename
   * shape required. Measured against the two dictionaries as they stand today:
   * zero hits, so this costs nothing and reds the day either falsehood lands.

   * ── A ROW THAT MEANS "NOT YET" MUST NOT READ AS "INCLUDED" ────────────────

   * roadmap items under the "Coming soon" label, and the ✗ rows of the in-app
   * Community panel. Nothing in the string itself says "not yet", so a reword
   * inverts the meaning while every structural guard stays green — the label is
   * still futurity, the polarity table still points at the same denied feature.
   *
   * Both misses on the strict copy-addition axis were this shape:
   *   soon4  -> "Custom domain & white-label — included forever, on every plan"
   *   f6     -> "Theme colour & badge removal, included"
   *
   * Guarded two ways, because either alone is escapable:
   *  1. SHAPE — a roadmap item is a bare label. Every one of the 32 shipped
   *     strings is a noun phrase with no clause break, so a sentence smuggled in
   *     beside it reds without anyone having to predict its words.
   *  2. VOCABULARY — availability and permanence wording, per locale, for the
   *     rewordings that stay short.

   *    still says "half", so the derived set still contains the key even after
   *    the list forgets it. It is circular in the OTHER direction (#338): a
   *    reword out of the vocabulary disappears from both sides at once, which
   *    is what `localeHalfClaimFaults` and the inventory are for.
   *

   * ── `everyValue()` REALLY SPLITS, MEASURED ON THE REAL DICTIONARIES ────────
   *
   * WHY THE SPLIT MATTERS (review M-3). `scoringFreeClaimFaults`'s affirmation
   * exemption is whole-TEXT by design — it has to be, or "every level is
   * available on every plan" could not be written at all. That makes splitting
   * the CALLER's job: a value fed in one piece lets an affirmation in sentence
   * one excuse a price claim in sentence two.
   *
   * WHY THIS TEST IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS (re-review, fix round 2). My first
   * attempt at pinning this called `scoringFreeClaimFaults` on a synthetic
   * two-sentence string. The re-reviewer reverted `everyValue()`'s `.flatMap`
   * back to whole-text and ALL FIVE tests in this block stayed green: that test
   * pinned the SCANNER, which was never at risk, while the call site — the one
   * `.flatMap` this is actually about — went unexercised. A fixture on both
   * ends proves the fixture.
   *
   * So this drives the REAL producer over the REAL dictionaries, three ways,
   * each of which fails on its own if the split is reverted:
   *   1. the scan must yield strictly MORE entries than there are values —
   *      equality is exactly what whole-text produces;
   *   2. every entry it yields must BE one sentence, and a violation names the
   *      locale, file and key that slipped through;
   *   3. one real, stable multi-sentence key must appear as several entries,
   *      so the rule is not satisfied by dictionaries that happen to be
   *      one-sentence throughout.
