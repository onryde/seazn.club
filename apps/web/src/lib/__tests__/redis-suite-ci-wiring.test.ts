// And REDIS_URL is deliberately NOT job-wide (setting it there switches the
// entitlement cache on for the whole `smoke` job, which breaks the src/server
// suites that mutate entitlements via raw SQL without invalidating), so each
// Redis-gated file gets its own hand-wired step that owns REDIS_URL for itself
// alone. Hand-wired means forgettable: add a new `*.redis.test.ts` file and it
// silently never runs in CI, which is exactly the shape of bug these suites
// exist to catch.
//
// This guard is pure — no DB, no Redis, no network — so it runs on every CI
// job and never self-skips. It is the one test in the family that CANNOT be
// silently switched off.
