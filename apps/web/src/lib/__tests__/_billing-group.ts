// Fixture helper for billing groups (V314).
//
// Billing moved off the org: `subscriptions` is now the GROUP (its own id,
// its own owner_user_id payer) and `organizations.subscription_id` points at
// it. The old fixture one-liner
//
//   insert into subscriptions (org_id, plan_key, status) values (..)
//   on conflict (org_id) do update set plan_key = ..
//
// therefore has no direct translation: there is no org_id to conflict on, and
// the insert alone leaves the org pointing nowhere. `setOrgPlan` is that
// upsert's replacement — one org, one group of its own, idempotent.
//
// Fixtures that need extra subscription columns (stripe ids, comped_until,
// dated status_changed_at, ...) write the CTE inline instead; only the plain
// plan/status case lives here.
