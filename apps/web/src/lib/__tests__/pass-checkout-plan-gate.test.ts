// The pass-checkout route refuses a paid org — "Your plan already includes
// every Event Pass feature." It used to decide that from the raw
// `subscriptions.plan_key` column, which keeps saying 'pro' after a comp lapses
// or a subscription is cancelled. So a lapsed org was told its plan covered the
// pass when it no longer did, and was blocked from a purchase it was entitled to
// make. Task 21 then made the upgrade page render from `orgPlanKey`, which
// applies those read-time degradations — leaving a visible buy button that 400s.
//
// The route now judges eligibility through the same resolver as the page, so
// there is one answer to "is this org on a paid plan".
//
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL.
