// The Event Pass rung ladder (v17 #294, spec A7).
//
// This is the data half of the M/L picker: the two rungs, in order, each with
// the price the buyer is quoted and the caps that are the WHOLE reason to pick
// one over the other. It is pure so the numbers can be pinned without Postgres;
// the caps themselves are read live from `plan_entitlements` by the upgrade page
// and handed in, exactly as the comparison table on that page reads them.
//
// What these tests protect: a rung whose advertised price came from the OTHER
// rung's price point. That is invisible on the page (both are plausible dollar
// amounts) and invisible to the charge (the charge resolves
// `plans.stripe_price_id_onetime` by key), so the only place it can be caught is
// here, comparing the two.
