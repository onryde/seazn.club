// webhook plus the past_due self-heal re-syncing plan_key from the subscription's
// price — resolved as Pro for ever, and needsRenewalResync returns false for
// canceled so nothing revisited it.
//
// The comp guard is the other half: compOrg deliberately leaves a dead
// subscription's cancelled status in place (admin-plan.ts), so 'canceled' + a
