 * the org's non-canceled add-on rows whose target matches, so
 * effective_cap = plan_base + bonus.
 *
 * Keyed by the org's WALLET (`coalesce(group_subscription_id, org_id)`, the
 * same billing entity `lib/credits` charges), because an add-on is bought by
 * the group payer once and lifts every org on the wallet — unless
 * `target_org_id` narrows it to one org. `status in ('active','granted')` is
 * the count set: 'active' (Stripe-paid) and 'granted' (admin) both lift the
 * cap; 'canceled' is frozen-not-deleted and does not.
 *
 * Scope (SPEC-2 §11.3): a null `target_org_id` is group-wide, a null
 * `target_competition_id` is any-comp. When `competitionId` is undefined — an
 * org-level cap like members.max — `target_competition_id = null` cannot match
 * a comp-scoped row, so ONLY any-comp rows count: a comp-scoped size pack must
 * never lift an org-level cap.
 *
 * Deliberately UNCACHED (unlike `resolve()`): a just-purchased seat must lift
 * the cap on the very next check, and a just-canceled one must drop it, without
 * waiting out the 300s entitlement TTL — which is exactly why the caller
 * (`getLimit`) sums this after `resolve()` returns, not inside it.
 *
 * This is the WALLET-keyed core (v17 gap #293), exported for callers that
 * already KNOW the wallet and have no org to resolve one through. The only such
 * caller today is `groupOrgLimit`'s every-org-suspended branch
 * (lib/billing-group.ts): the subscription id it is asked about IS the wallet,
 * and every live org in the group is suspended, so the org-keyed `addonBonus`
 * below cannot reach that case at all.
 *
 * Omitting `orgId` narrows the sum to GROUP-WIDE rows only (`target_org_id is
 * null`) — correct for a cap like orgs.max_owned, which is a property of the
 * group and is never meaningfully scoped to one member org.

 * transaction as the insert or two concurrent creates both read the pre-insert
 * count and both land (doc 10 §2 rule 1). But `withinLimit` reaches `getLimit`
 * -> `resolve` -> a query on the POOLED `sql` proxy, and issuing that from
 * inside a `withTenant` callback asks the pool for a SECOND connection while
 * the first is still pinned — the self-deadlock the guard in `lib/db.ts` exists
 * to catch, which hung production twice on 2026-08-05.
 *
 * Only the plan LOOKUP moves out. The count and the insert stay inside one
 * transaction, so the race doc 10 §2 rule 1 is about is untouched: the limit is
 * a property of the org's PLAN, already served through a 300-second cache, and
 * was never something the transaction protected.
 *
 * `null` is unlimited. A missing `plan_entitlements` row resolves to 0 through
 * `getLimit` and therefore refuses — the same answer `withinLimit` gives, so
 * the two halves cannot disagree about where the boundary is.
