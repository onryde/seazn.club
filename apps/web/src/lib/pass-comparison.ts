/**
 * The pass-vs-plan comparison the upgrade page renders (spec D10: "a
 * pass-vs-Pro comparison naming real limits").
 *
 * ── Why the numbers are not written down here ───────────────────────────────
 * The page this replaced hardcoded its claims in the dictionary, and one of
 * them was simply false: `upgrade.includes.entrants` promised "32 entrants per
 * division (Free: 16)" while the live matrix says the pass grants 64 and
 * Community already allows 32 — the offer undersold itself by half and libelled
 * the free plan, in four languages. Copy that quotes a limit rots the moment
 * `plan_entitlements` moves, and nothing fails when it does.
 *
 * So this module owns only the SHAPE of the table — which rows, in what order,
 * read from which entitlement keys — and every figure in it is read from
 * `plan_entitlements` at render time, by the same keys the resolver enforces.
 * The page cannot claim a limit the product does not grant.
 *
 * Pure: no DB, no React, no i18n. The page supplies the rows' values and turns
 * `CompareCell` into words in the viewer's language.
