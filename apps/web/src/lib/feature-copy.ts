  // the way forward is the group's plan — not a per-org purchase. Never says
  // "clubs", which is a separate in-org entity with its own clubs.max cap.
  // Fires for BOTH caps: the per-USER limit (creating one org too many for your
  // plan — Community allows 1) and the per-GROUP limit (a shared bill that is
  // full). Worded to make sense for either, and to name the upgrade path and the
  // half-price extra-org rule rather than the raw key. v17 gap #293: the way
  // past the cap on a PAID plan is now a purchase (the recurring extra-org
  // rider), not an upgrade — the 402 carries { offer: "extra_org" } alongside
  // this sentence, so the copy has to name the same remedy the machine hint
  // does. `feature-copy.test.ts` pins that pairing.
  //
  // MAKES NO RATE CLAIM, deliberately. There are TWO different prices for "an
  // extra organisation" and they only agree monthly: the plan price's second
  // graduated tier (what the orgs already on the bill cost — 900/1900 a month,
  // but 7900/16300 a YEAR) and the rider SKU this offer sells, which is
  // monthly-only at 900/1900. So "the same rate as the ones already on your
  // bill" is true for a monthly group and ~37% wrong for an annual one, and
  // "half your plan's rate" is a claim about the tier, not about this. The
  // figure belongs to the Add-ons page (Task 6), which knows the currency and
  // reads it from the rider SKU; this sentence names only the CADENCE, which is
  // true on every plan and in every currency.
