// helpers pull the two sides + numerals back out so the feed card and post hero

/**
 * The eyebrow's colour, by the GROUND it is painted on.
 *
 * The tone vocabulary was designed for the night-mode slab — a hero image's
 * overlay, a scorebug — where "white" means white. Three surfaces then copied
 * ONE map between them and two of them used the dark values on a light card:
 * `white` resolves to `#f7f5fb` and `bg-surface` is `#ffffff`, which measures
 * about **1.07:1**. A `round_recap` or `weekly_digest` post with no hero image
 * rendered its eyebrow invisible — on the public news feed and on the post page
 * itself, observed live, not inferred.
 *
 * `lime` is the same story one step less severe: `#a3e635` on white is ~1.7:1.
 * It only ever looked right because a RESULT post with a numeric scoreline gets
 * the dark scorebug — the documented fallback for a result whose title is NOT a
 * clean scoreline (a forfeit) put lime on white.
 *
 * Two maps, named for the ground, so a caller has to say which it is painting
 * on. The light values are not invented here: they are the ones
 * `(public)/shared/[orgSlug]/page.tsx` already worked out for its latest-news
 * strip, which is the one surface of the three that was correct.
