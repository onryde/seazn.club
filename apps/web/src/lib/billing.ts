 * Which Event Pass rung a checkout session bought, or `null` if the session is

 * shared by reconcile-on-return and the webhook so the two can never disagree
 * about what a session means.
 *
 * Two deliberately different answers to two different questions:
 *
 *  - `pass_key` ABSENT → `null`, refuse. Its absence is precisely how a pass
 *    session is told apart from a subscription / credit-pack / size-pack
 *    checkout, none of which ever set it. Widening this to "assume pass" would
 *    make every subscription checkout try to record a competition pass.
 *  - `pass_key` PRESENT but unrecognised → fall back to M. Every real session
 *    has carried `event_pass` since v3/07, so this is a robustness net (metadata
 *    drift, a typo in a future rung), not a migration path: dropping a paid
 *    session on the floor is strictly worse than filing it under the cheaper
 *    rung, which at least leaves the buyer entitled and the money traceable.
 *
 * That fallback is now CHECKED rather than trusted, and the distinction matters
 * because the two policies read as contradictory otherwise (v17 gap #326 review
 * finding 3). `passSessionRungMatchesPrice` runs on the answer this returns, so:
 *
 *   · an unrecognised rung on a session actually built on **M's price** still
 *     mints as M — the robustness net works exactly as described above;
 *   · an unrecognised rung on a session built on **anything else** is refused,
 *     recorded and alerted, because filing a $59 charge under the $29 rung is
 *     not "leaving the buyer entitled", it is quietly under-delivering a product
 *     they paid for. The refusal is recoverable by a human who can see both
 *     numbers; the silent mis-filing was not recoverable at all, because nothing
 *     in the data said it had happened.
 *   · and where the price cannot be compared at all (an unconfigured rung), the
 *     old behaviour survives untouched.
 *
 * So the net is narrowed, not defeated. `pass-checkout-plan-gate.test.ts` drives
 * an unrecognised `pass_key` through the guard both ways so the two halves of
 * this policy cannot drift apart again.

/**
 * Does the price this session was actually built on agree with the rung its

 *
 * `pass_key` is server-written, so this is not a tampering guard — the risk is
 * entirely internal. Both mint paths take the rung from metadata and NOTHING
 * cross-checked it against the price the buyer was charged, so a desync between
 * the checkout route's price lookup and its metadata stamp — a stale
 * `stripe:sync`, a price id edited in the Dashboard, a future third rung wired
 * to the wrong lookup key — produced a customer who paid $29 and held the $59
 * rung (or the reverse) with no error, no failing test, and nothing in the data
 * to find it by afterwards. The W5 review reproduced exactly that by making the
 * checkout route resolve M's price for every rung. The two pre-sale witnesses
 * that catch it (`e2e/event-pass.spec.ts`, `pass-checkout-l.live.test.ts`) are
 * both opt-in and neither runs in CI, and after a sale completes nothing looked
 * again.
 *
 * Returns `false` to REFUSE the mint. Refusing rather than guessing is the
 * posture this codebase already takes for an undetermined pass credit reversal:
 * nothing here can tell which of the two sides is the wrong one, so minting
 * either rung is a coin flip with the customer's money. Every refusal WRITES A
 * ROW (`pass_mint_refusals`, V342) and then alerts, in that order — the row is
 * the record, the email is only the notification, and a bounced email must not
 * be the difference between a traceable incident and none. That row is also the
 * brake: `POST /api/billing/pass-checkout` refuses a repeat purchase for a
 * competition that has an unresolved one, because without it a refused buyer
 * lands back on the upgrade page looking at a live buy button.
 *
 * **Fail-OPEN wherever the comparison cannot be made**, and each case is a
 * deliberate choice, not an oversight:
 *
 *  - **No `plans` row, or a NULL `stripe_price_id_onetime` for the rung.** This
 *    is the NORMAL state of every environment `stripe:sync` has not been run
 *    against, including the test database. It is also not a state a new session
 *    can be created in: the checkout route reads the same column and 503s on a
 *    NULL, so the only sessions that can reach here are older than the wipe.
 *    Checked FIRST, before any Stripe call, so the common unconfigured case
 *    costs one indexed read and nothing else — the same "cheap guard first"
 *    discipline as the maybeAlert* wrappers.
 *  - **The line-item lookup threw.** A transient Stripe failure must not convert
 *    a good purchase into a non-purchase; that blast radius dwarfs the internal
 *    desync being guarded. Logged, because unlike the case above it IS
 *    anomalous — but log-only, because it says nothing about the SESSION.
 *
 * A session reporting no single line item is NOT in that list. It is not
 * transient noise: it means the session does not have the shape
 * `buildPassCheckoutParams` produces, which is the same desync class this guard
 * exists for. It refuses, records and alerts like a mismatch.
 *
 * **LOOKUP KEY BEATS PRICE ID, and this is the interesting part.** The route
 * resolves the price at session-CREATE time and this runs at MINT time, so a
 * `stripe:sync` that re-mints a rung's one-time price in between would refuse
 * every session still in flight — charging those buyers and minting nothing,
 * the precise outcome this guard exists to prevent, triggered by a routine
 * deploy step (and this wave ships a new rung, so that sync WILL run). Stripe's
 * `transfer_lookup_key` moves `seazn_event_pass{,_l}` onto the replacement
 * price, so the lookup key is the rung's DURABLE identity where the price id is
 * only its current one — exactly the reasoning `isOrgAddonItem` already applies
 * to subscription items. So a price whose `lookup_key` still names this rung is
 * accepted even when the id has moved. The id comparison stays as the primary
 * check because the seed could one day ship a rung with no lookup key at all.
 *
 * Line items are read from `session.line_items` when the caller already expanded
 * them (reconcile-on-return does, at no extra cost, and that path re-runs on
 * every render of the bookmarkable `?checkout=success&session_id=` URL), and
 * fetched otherwise — the webhook holds a session off an event payload, which
 * can carry no expansion at all. The fallback is what stops a mint path that
 * forgets to expand from silently skipping the check.

      // credit attempt, a wholly separate concern, did not. Caught locally so

      // groupAlreadyRedeemed makes retrying free) rather than reconcileCheckout
      // reporting the sync itself as failed.
