 * ONE list, because the table used to have three: a hardcoded `where plan_key
 * in (…)` in the page's query, a fixed set of named fields on `PricingRow`,
 * and a hand-written `<th>` row. Adding the L rung (v17 #294) meant a plan
 * could be in the query and still have nowhere to render — and a plan with
 * nowhere to render inherits the neighbouring column's numbers, which on this
 * page means quoting M's 128-entrant ceiling to someone paying to remove it.
 * Deriving the query, the row shape and the headings from this tuple makes
 * that class of gap a type error instead.
 *
 * Entitlements v18: derived from `lib/currency.ts`'s `ALL_PLAN_KEYS` — every
 * plan in the database — filtered down to the four PURCHASABLE columns.
 * `enterprise` is never a `/pricing` column (design §4: it's the Contact-us
 * strip below the table, not a priced offer); `lib/entitlement-admin.ts`'s
 * `ADMIN_PLAN_KEYS` derives from the same list unfiltered, so a plan added to
 * one can't be forgotten on the other.
