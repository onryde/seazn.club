// Event Pass discovery inside a competition (spec D3, task 19).
//
// Until now `routes.competitionUpgrade` had exactly ONE inbound link — the
// paywall in <UpgradeGate>. The pass was therefore only findable by an
// organiser who had already been blocked, which is the worst moment to meet a
// price. This is the same offer, in the competition's own chrome, before the
// refusal.
//
// It reads `usePassGateState()` rather than re-deriving anything: the
// competition layout already resolved BOTH facts (pass row present, org on a
// paid plan) once per request, and there must stay exactly one definition of
// which upsell is honest here.
//
//   paid_plan → nothing. Pro's matrix is a strict superset of the pass's at
//               every key the pass lifts, so an invitation to buy one here
//               sells a DOWNGRADE. This is the defect fixed in the gate by
//               f70b8e52; a new surface must not reintroduce it.
//   ended     → the org bought this competition's pass and it has STOPPED
//               applying — the competition reached a terminal status, or ran
//               past its end date plus grace (SPEC-4 §7). Three things are true
//               at once and the card has to hold all three: the pass is not
//               lifting anything any more, the row is never deleted, and it can
//               never be re-bought (pass-checkout refuses on an existing row,
//               and `competition_passes` is keyed on competition_id alone). So
//               this state is neither "held" — saying "Event Pass M active" over
//               a pass the resolver stopped honouring was the literal v17 gap
//               #301 P1 defect — nor "none", which would put the buy link on a
//               purchase the API will refuse. It is its own card, and it points
//               at the two things that CAN still help: next season, and a plan.
//   closed    → the competition is past the line and NEVER held a pass (#376).
//               Not `ended` (that card reports a purchase stopping, and there
//               was no purchase) and not `none` (that one offers a sale the
//               route answers with 410 Gone). One link, chosen by reason: a
//               finished competition points at next season, a stale end date
//               points at the settings form that makes the pass buyable again.
//   held      → the "on" signal, never a buy link. Presence is ROW EXISTENCE:
//               a staff-granted pass has a null `stripe_payment_intent` and is
//               fully active, so it must read as active here too (spec D1). The
//               signal NAMES the rung (v17 #294) — nothing else in this
//               competition's chrome says whether the $29 or the $59 pass is
//               the one running.
//   none      → the offer.
//
// Outside a competition there is no provider and the hook answers "none", so
// this component must never be mounted where `href` cannot name a competition.
