 *  per that file's comment). OBS reloads this browser source on every scene
 *  change, so identifying it as a "visitor" would fire a doomed, anonymous
 *  /api/users/me fetch every reload from a machine that can never be signed
 *  in — inflating analytics with non-human "viewers" and putting avoidable
 *  requests on a live-broadcast path. */

/**
 * Client-mounted (task-8: make the public tree actually ISR in production).
 * The old version was a server component that called getCurrentUser() (->
 * cookies()) directly from the ROOT layout — that forces EVERY route rendered
 * through it to render dynamically the moment NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY is set
 * (task-7's audited finding). This version resolves the same identity
 * (userId/orgId/orgName/plan) via lib/analytics-identity (a fetch to
 * GET /api/users/me, sessionStorage-memoized) instead, keeping the root
 * layout's RSC tree cookie-free. AnalyticsIdentify (the actual
 * posthog.identify/group call) is unchanged.
 *
 * Lifecycle (task-8 review fix, Critical finding): the effect is keyed on the
 * pathname, not run-once — logins here are SOFT navigations (magic-link.tsx
 * does router.push + refresh), so an empty-dep effect would never identify a
 * user who signed in after first paint. Conversely, logout-button calls
 * clearAnalyticsIdentity() + posthog.reset() before ITS soft navigation,
 * resetting the identified-this-tab flag and the cache, so this effect
 * re-resolves (and 401s → stays anonymous) instead of carrying a stale
 * identity into the next session.
