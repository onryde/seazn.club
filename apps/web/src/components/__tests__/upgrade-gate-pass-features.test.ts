// <UpgradeGate>'s PASS_FEATURES is the ONLY thing standing between a blocked
// user and the $29 path: a key missing from it renders the Pro-only card, so
// the pass that would have unblocked them is never offered. It is hand-written
// prose about a database table, and it drifted — it carried three keys the pass
// does not lift (`registration.paid`, `branding`, and `exports`, which is not
// even a gate key) while five real ones (player profiles, branded exports, both
// sponsor keys and the AI run cap) were missing.
//
// So stop hand-maintaining it against a spec doc. This derives the lifted set
// from the live `plan_entitlements` matrix — the same query
// lib/__tests__/pass-scoping-guard.test.ts uses — and fails when the component
// disagrees with it.
//
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL (CI sets it, see
// .github/workflows/ci.yml).
