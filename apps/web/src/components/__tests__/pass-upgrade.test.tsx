// The Event Pass M/L picker (v17 #294, spec A7) — the wave's one buyer-facing
// money surface.
//
// The failure this file exists to catch, in one sentence: **the buyer picks L
// and the POST body says M.** Nothing else in the stack can see that. The route
// happily sells whatever rung it is handed, `recordPassPurchase` records it,
// Stripe charges for it, and every assertion downstream agrees with itself —
// the only witness that the buyer asked for something else is the click.
//
// ── How this is tested without a DOM ────────────────────────────────────────
// vitest runs `environment: "node"` here and the workspace has no jsdom, so a
// `useState` component cannot be clicked (see competition-pass-entry.test.tsx
// and pass-checkout-parity.test.tsx for the same constraint). Two seams make
// that survivable:
//
//   `PassRungLadder`  hookless, so it can be CALLED and its returned element
//                     tree walked — including invoking the very handlers a
//                     browser would. This is where "which rung the button
//                     means" lives, so this is where the click can be faked.
//   `beginPassCheckout`  the one place a rung becomes money, lifted out of the
//                     component with an injectable fetch.
//
// Those two seams leave one JOIN unwitnessed: the stateful shell that carries
// the selection from the ladder to `beginPassCheckout`. That join is exactly
// the mis-sale above — substituting a literal `"event_pass"` for `passKey`
// inside `PassUpgradeButton.start` used to pass every suite AND `tsc`. So the
// last describe in this file drives the SHELL too, with the ~30-line hook
// harness below. See its comment for why that is not as reckless as it reads.
