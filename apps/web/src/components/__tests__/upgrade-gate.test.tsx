// <UpgradeGate>'s three states (spec 2026-07-21 D1, task 17).
//
// The failure being fixed: a community org that has ALREADY BOUGHT the $29
// Event Pass for the competition it is looking at was still offered that same
// pass at every paywall underneath it. The gate inferred the pass CTA from
// usePathname() alone, so "am I in a competition" was the only question it
// could ask; "do we already own this one" was unanswerable.
//
// Task 16 made it answerable: the competition layout resolves
// `competition_passes` once and provides it through CompetitionPassProvider.
// This file pins what the gate does with that answer.
//
//   pass NOT held, liftable feature   → both paths (unchanged)
//   pass HELD, liftable feature       → Pro only; the pass is at its ceiling
//   pass HELD, non-pass feature       → Pro only; "not included in the Event Pass"
//   PAID PLAN, anything               → Pro only; the pass is moot
//   no provider (org-level page)      → exactly as before, no pass wording
//
// The fourth row is task 17's own deferred follow-up. `usePassActive()` answered
// only "does a pass ROW exist", so an org already on a paid plan read false and
// was offered the pass — which for a Pro org is a DOWNGRADE, not a redundant
// sale: Pro's matrix is a superset of the pass's at every key the pass lifts.
// The layout now carries the resolved plan alongside the pass row and the gate
// reads one union.
//
// Rendered through react-dom/server, like competition-pass-provider.test.tsx:
// the suite runs in the node environment and the gate has no effects.
