// The Extra organisations control (v17 gap #293, SPEC-6 §A5) — the wave's
// buyer-facing money surface.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `extraOrgsErrorKey` is pinned as a MAP by
// lib/__tests__/extra-orgs-copy.test.ts, and the route's four refusals are
// pinned by extra-org-addon.test.ts. Neither witnesses the one line where the
// two meet. Replacing `extraOrgsErrorKey(failedStatus)` with a literal generic
// key collapses 409 ("change plan"), 422 ("change the number") and 423 ("move
// an organisation out") into "That didn't work. Try again." — three different
// customer actions become one shrug — and every other suite in the repo stays
// green, as does `tsc`. The same is true of the server floor: swapping
// `parsed >= min` for `parsed >= 0` silently un-bounds the stepper.
//
// Screenshots are evidence for a moment. This is the regression test.
//
// Rendered with the `environment: "node"` hook harness (./_hook-harness) —
// the same one pass-upgrade.test.tsx uses, for the same reason.
