  // cookies (proved in stream-overlay.spec.ts, Task 8).

  // WHY HERE, and not in the overlay layout. `CookieConsent` is mounted ONCE,
  // in the ROOT layout (`app/layout.tsx`), as a SIBLING of `children` — a
  // nested segment layout cannot unmount it. Next's only other route to a
  // banner-free segment is deleting `app/layout.tsx` and giving every route
  // group its own root layout with its own `<html>`, which is a repo-wide
  // restructure for one page. One condition, in the component that owns the
  // decision, is the smallest correct change; `AnalyticsBootstrap` already
  // reads `usePathname` from this same root-layout position, so the pattern
  // is the tree's, not this wave's.
