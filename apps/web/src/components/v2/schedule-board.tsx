   * is a non-empty string. On an empty board `days` is `[startAt]` (or today),
   * so an Auto-schedule that places the matches on any other day left `day`
   * pointing at a date the board no longer has: `dayFixtures` filters to
   * nothing and the organiser reads an EMPTY grid over a board that is in fact
   * fully scheduled. It never self-corrected, because nothing downstream of the
   * RSC refresh looks at the tab again.
   *
   * So the tab is a DEFAULT rather than a pin: it is re-derived when the day
   * list itself changes and the current tab has fallen out of it. The list is
   * compared BY VALUE — `days` is a fresh array on every render (`scheduled` is
   * a `filter` over `board`), so an identity check would re-derive constantly
   * and fight the ± day arrows below, which deliberately step onto empty days
   * that are NOT in `days`. Those stay untouched: paging to an empty day does
   * not change the list, so nothing snaps back. Render-time state adjustment,
   * the same "derive from props" pattern `useBoardActions` uses for overrides —
   * no effect cascade, and the corrected tab renders in this same pass.
