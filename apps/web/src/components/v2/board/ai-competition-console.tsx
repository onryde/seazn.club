// The JOINT AI console (#350 §9) — the competition board's own dock.
//
// It is a sibling of `ai-console.tsx`, not a mode of it. The division console is
// a four-step wizard over two phases (schedule, then officials); a joint run is
// ONE phase over several divisions — officials stay per division by design
// decision — so a shared component would have been a wizard with three of its
// four steps switched off. What the two DO share is everything that touches
// money: `quoteFor`, the receipt, and the rung semantics, all imported.
//
// The design is the division console's chrome with one addition, because that is
// the one thing this surface knows and the other cannot: a DIVISION LEDGER. The
// same list of divisions is read three times over — as what the run will cover
// (the picker), as what it costs (the receipt's one line each), and as what it
// placed (the review's rows) — in the same order, so an organiser can follow one
// division straight down the dock. Everything else is the board's existing
// slate/violet vocabulary; the only new colour is the tint each division already
// wears on its cards.
//
// Three things this surface has to say that the per-division one never does, all
// of them consequences of merging divisions that were configured separately:
//   * courts are matched BY NAME and nothing else;
//   * the divisions may be set to different timezones while the board renders in
//     the reader's own (ruling R8);
//   * a person clash is a WARNING at plan time and a REFUSAL at apply time, but
//     only if one of the selected divisions opted into `crossPersonClash: hard`.
