// Result strip (z3 auto-schedule, Task 11) — what the solver actually achieved,
// stated plainly, directly under the green "Placed N matches" notice.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. The solver is *anytime*: it returns the best board it found
// inside a time budget, which may be neither optimal nor complete. Every number
// it reports is therefore a claim that has to be qualified, and the strip is
// where that qualification lives. A strip showing only the happy numbers would
// be worse than no strip, because it implies a completeness the run did not
// deliver. Three rules follow from that, and they are what the tests pin:
//
//   1. `placed` vs `total` is stated whenever they differ. The green notice
//      above says how many landed; only this line says how many did not.
//   2. `budget_expired` is never swallowed. "Improved 2 of 4 targets and then
//      stopped" is the honest reading of a truncated anytime run.
//   3. `infeasible` is a proof about the PINNED cards, not about the board.
//      Measured on the engine lane: 20 clean fixtures + 2 contradictory pins
//      returns 20 placed with exactly those 2 dropped. Rendering that as "no
//      schedule is possible" would be false and unactionable, so the copy names
//      the placement split and the pins and nothing else.
//
// DESIGN. Deliberately never green: the emerald notice directly above already
// carries the good news, and the strip's whole job is the part that line does
// not say. Two tones only — neutral slate when there is nothing to flag, amber
// when there is. The metrics sit in a hairline grid (gap-px over a tinted
// container) that reflows 4 -> 2 columns at mobile without ever overflowing the
// page, and a plain-language legend under it explains the two labels that are
// jargon, so the explanation survives on touch where a tooltip would not.
