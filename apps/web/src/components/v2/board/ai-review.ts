// W5 (#400, #388) — the ONE definition of a reviewable row, and the ONE
// definition of how many there are.
//
// #388: "N warnings to review" sat above a column of amber rows that were not
// all warnings, so the number disagreed with the screen. This wave makes that
// worse by adding two more categories — fixtures the solver gave up on, and the
// architect's own assumptions. The fix is structural rather than arithmetic:
// both consoles build the SAME array here, the panel renders that array, and
// the count is that array's length. A second count derived from
// `plan.warnings.length` anywhere is the original defect with a bigger number.
//
// Pure: no JSX, no hooks, no dict. The panel does the localizing.
