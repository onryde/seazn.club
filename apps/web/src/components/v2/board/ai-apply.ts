// chain: a "before-ai" checkpoint (so the apply is one Undo away), the schedule
// apply(s), the officials apply, then the ticked constraint-suggestion PUT — in
// that order, nothing skipped mid-flight. The console owns the UI; this module
// owns the sequence and the outcome branches it returns.
//
// The API seam is injected (defaults to apiV1) so the test can record call
// order + payloads and simulate a stale-seq 409 without a real server. apiV1
// already unwraps the v1 envelope and throws ApiV1Error with the typed code, so
// SEQ_CONFLICT (another organiser edited the board) is distinguishable from a
// blocking SCHEDULE_CONFLICT — only the former offers "re-run as refine".
