// W5 (#400) Task 6 — reading a compiled hard constraint back to the organiser.
//
// The preview card is a receipt: the organiser typed a sentence, and before a
// credit is spent we show them the rules the referee will actually check. This
// module is the translation layer between the engine's `HardConstraint` union
// and that sentence. It is deliberately React-free so the six readings can be
// unit-tested without a DOM, and so the joint console (Task 7) reads the same
// words from the same place.
//
// TWO RULES HOLD THIS FILE TOGETHER:
//
// 1. `describeHardConstraint` is an exhaustive switch with a `never` default.
//    A seventh `HardConstraint` variant must fail to COMPILE, not render a
//    blank ledger row — the same discipline `RULE_BY_REASON` uses for
//    `ConflictReason`. A blank row in a card whose whole job is "here is what
//    will be enforced" is worse than no card at all.
//
// 2. Every word comes from the dictionary via `msg`/`plural`. Nothing here
//    concatenates an English sentence: an organiser reading the French app must
//    not meet English rules on the one screen that tells them what they are
//    paying for.
//
// The TOKENS are the exception, and on purpose. `REST`, `MAX/DAY`, `≥ TIME` …
// are the engine's own six constraint kinds rendered as a code, in the same
// register as the `CAP` rule chips and the `FN`/`JR` markers already on this
// board — a short stable vocabulary that means the same thing in every locale
// and comes back verbatim when a conflict later cites the rule. Translating
// them would give the same rule four names. Rule CODES (H2/H4/H8) are NOT used
// here: every compiled instruction rule verifies as H8, so that chip would
// print the same character on every row and say nothing.
//
// That defence only holds for a SYMBOL or an ABBREVIATION. #400 Task 6b: the
// first four tokens shipped as English words — `PER DAY`, `WEEKDAY`,
// `NOT BEFORE`, `NOT AFTER` — which the `CAP`/`FN`/`JR` precedent does not
// cover, and a French organiser met four of them on the signature element of
// the screen that tells them what they are paying for. The forms below are the
// shortest stable codes the six kinds can carry: a comparison glyph for the two
// that were phrases, and single abbreviations for the rest — a code to be
// learned once, not an English sentence fragment to be read. Adding a seventh
// kind means picking a token that survives the same reading.
