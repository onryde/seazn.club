// The JOINT accept (#350 Task 8) — the multi-division twin of `applyAiPlans`.
//
// It exists for one reason the per-stage chain cannot serve: the joint plan is
// written by ONE endpoint (`POST /competitions/{id}/schedule/apply`, atomic
// across divisions), so the board never runs `ai-apply.ts`, and the undo anchor
// that chain creates before it writes never gets created either. A joint apply
// therefore overwrote several divisions' boards with no restore point at all.
//
// There is no competition-scoped CHECKPOINT endpoint, so the anchor is still
// per division: one `kind: "ai"` checkpoint for every division the apply will
// touch, taken BEFORE the write. `kind: "ai"` anchors are exempt from the
// save-point quota (V303), so this costs a Community org nothing. The UNDO is
// competition-scoped (#386) — it hands every anchor to one endpoint rather than
// looping the per-division restore from the browser, which is what used to let
// a closed tab leave the board half-restored.
//
// Pure and React-free with an injected api seam, exactly as ai-apply.ts is, so
// the call order and the payloads are assertable without a server.

 *                joint apply wrote, i.e. the competition has been applied again
