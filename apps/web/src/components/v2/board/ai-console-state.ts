// AI schedule console — pure state machine (v4 Task 11, design/v4/00-03).
//
// The console is a four-step wizard over the two-phase AI architect: write a
// brief, review the engine-verified schedule proposal, optionally assign
// officials, then apply. This module is deliberately React-free so the gating
// (you can't reach officials without a schedule plan; apply is reachable
// straight from schedule; an error never discards the proposal you're looking
// at) is unit-testable in isolation. Tasks 12–16 consume these types verbatim.

   * THIS VALUE TOUCHES MONEY. It has three consumers, and the first of them is

   *   1. `ai-console.tsx` `onAdopt` sends it as the run's own `instruction` —

   *      `freeDraftQuote` over `quoteRun` server-side (`officials-ai.ts:1104`,
   *      spent at `:1130`). Empty here = charged 1; non-empty = charged 1/2/3.
   *   2. `officialsPlanBody` puts it on the wire as `prior.instruction`.
   *   3. the apply audit line.
   * Because (1) both sets the price and is what the confirm card reads
   * (`adoptInstruction`), the two cannot drift: a wrong value here changes the
   * quote and the charge together. Anything that makes the card read a
   * DIFFERENT string than `onAdopt` sends reopens the under-quote.
