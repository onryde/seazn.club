// W6 (#401): the AI diff panel reports what the constraint solver repaired
// before the model was asked again.
//
// Four properties, each of which fails differently and silently if it regresses:
//
//   * The strip is absent when the solver did nothing. A status panel that fires
//     on every no-op stops being read, and then it fails to communicate on the
//     one run where it mattered.
//   * The minimality sentence appears ONLY on `proved`. The engine returns
//     `upper_bound` whenever a day cap couples components and deliberately
//     declines to claim minimality there; printing "no smaller change would have
//     worked" on an upper bound would be a lie the engine refused to tell.
//   * Leftovers for the model are shown. A repair that half-worked and says
//     nothing is worse than one that admits it.
//   * Nothing here is hardcoded English.
//
// Assertions anchor on `="` for the data-* probes. React serialises an omitted
// prop as `"$undefined"`, so a bare `data-moved` substring is present whether the
// attribute was set or not, and the test would pass in both states.
