// The unscheduled tray needs a handle, because "the board repainted" is a
// statement about this component and nothing else.
//
// The open bug it exists to make assertable: after Auto-schedule + apply, the
// board has been observed rendering an empty grid with every card still docked
// here, while the result strip reports N of N scheduled and Postgres confirms
// the rows persisted. That is the client not repainting, and it does not
// self-correct. Until now the only handle on this tray was a translated
// `aria-label`, so no spec could say "every card left the tray" without
// asserting copy — which is banned on this surface (#465) and would red on a
// re-wording rather than on the defect.
//
// Two ids because the desktop dock and the mobile sheet BOTH render (the split
// is CSS, `lg:block` / `lg:hidden`), so one shared id would match twice and a
// 375px assertion would silently be answered by the desktop node.
//
// `data-count` rather than counting rendered blocks: it is the number the
// component itself is acting on, so it cannot agree with a body that failed to
// render. Anchored on `="` throughout — React serialises an omitted prop as the
// string "$undefined", so a bare presence probe passes in both states.
