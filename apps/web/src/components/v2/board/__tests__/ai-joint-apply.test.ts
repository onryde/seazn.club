// The JOINT accept (#350 Task 8). The plan endpoint charges credits; this is
// the step that turns the paid-for plan into a board, and the two things it
// must never get wrong are both invisible in a render:
//
//   1. THE UNDO ANCHOR. The per-stage chain (ai-apply.ts) creates a checkpoint
//      before it writes, which is where the applied state's one-tap Undo
//      restores to. The joint apply does not go through that chain, so without
//      this module a joint apply leaves the organiser no restore point at all —
//      a several-division board overwritten with no way back.
//   2. WHAT THE PAYLOAD CARRIES. A fixture set aside stays at its OLD slot,
//      where it is still a court obstacle; a division left with nothing after
//      that filtering must drop out entirely, because the request schema is
//      `assignments.min(1)` per division and a 400 here reads as a bug.
//
// The api seam is injected so call ORDER and payloads are assertable without a
// server, exactly as ai-apply.test.ts does it.
