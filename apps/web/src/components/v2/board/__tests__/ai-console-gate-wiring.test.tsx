// W5 (#400) Task 6b — the confirm gate where the REQUEST is made.
//
// The wave's headline guarantee is that a run cannot be POSTed until the
// organiser has read what their sentence compiles to and agreed to it. That
// guarantee has two halves, and only one of them was pinned:
//
//   * the JSX half — the brief step renders the receipt card instead of the run
//     button — which `ai-console-preview-gate.test.ts` covers through `canRun`;
//   * the CALLBACK half — `run()` re-checks `canRun` before it calls the api,
//     because a `disabled` attribute is a hint and the money is spent by the
//     fetch, not by the button.
//
// Deleting the second one left all 47 tests of this feature green: the reducer
// suite never calls `run`, and no static render can. So this drives the real
// console through the shared hook harness and reads the network it touched.
//
// The assertion is on POSTs only. The console GETs its roster, its last run and
// its schedule settings on mount, and those are free — it is the chargeable
// verb that must not fire.
