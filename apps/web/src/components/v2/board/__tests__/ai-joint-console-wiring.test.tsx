// The JOINT console's WIRING — the arguments, not the functions.
//
// `jointRunBody` and `runJointPlan` are both pinned by their own suite, and
// `JointReviewStep` is pinned by rendering it with raw inputs. None of that
// touches the two lines where the console hands those functions their
// arguments, and that is where the money bug lives:
//
//     runJointPlan({ competitionId, selected, instruction, rungs, prior }, …)
//
// Replacing `selected` with every division on the board and `rungs` with `{}`
// left the whole suite green — the receipt prices two divisions at the picked
// rungs while the request runs four at the server's own prediction, and the
// server charges from the request. A test that is HANDED `selected` and `rungs`
// cannot see it; only one that makes the console compute them can.
//
// So this drives the real component: pick a rung on the receipt, type a brief,
// click the CTA, and read the body that reached the api. Same for the review
// step's props — `error`, `running` and `undoFailed` were all inert-able green
// at the mount, so C-1's affordance, I-1's disclosure and I-5's naming could
// each be unwired without a single red.
//
// There is no DOM here (vitest `environment: "node"`, no jsdom), so the clicks
// go through the shared hook harness — see components/__tests__/_hook-harness.
