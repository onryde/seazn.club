// W5 (#400) — a failed COMPILE has to say something, and leave a way out.
//
// The preview is the cheap half of the gate: it compiles the organiser's
// sentence for free so they can read the rules before paying to run against
// them. That makes its failure modes load-bearing rather than edge cases — 402
// (empty wallet), 409, 429, 5xx and offline all land here, and the organiser's
// only signal was a spinner that stopped.
//
// The cause was a state coupling no render test could see: `PREVIEW_ERROR`
// stores the error but deliberately does NOT set `run` (that field describes
// the architect run, and a free compile never started one), while the brief
// step's error block was gated on `state.run === "error"`. Every preview
// failure therefore rendered nothing at all. This suite pins the block on the
// preview's own status, in every language, and pins that the retry the
// organiser needs is still on screen underneath it.
