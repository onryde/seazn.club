// Task 11 — the JOIN between the auto-schedule response and the result strip.
//
// The strip itself is pinned by result-strip.test.tsx. What no static render can
// see is whether `useBoardActions.autoRun` ever hands it anything, and the two
// ways that goes wrong are both silent:
//
//   1. `autoRun` returns EARLY when the proposal is empty. An `infeasible` run
//      can place nothing at all — and that is precisely the run whose report the
//      organiser most needs — so capturing the telemetry after that return would
//      hide the strip on the one board that has to explain itself.
//   2. `metrics`/`solver` are declared on the /schedule/auto response schema and
//      Task 9 now populates them — but the hook still types them OPTIONAL, and
//      deliberately. A cached response or a server one deploy behind carries
//      neither, and typing them as required would render a board of zeros
//      instead of no strip at all. So the hook must still leave `lastRun` null
//      when the wire is silent, which is what the last spec here pins.
//
// Driven through the shared hook dispatcher harness — vitest runs `environment:
// "node"` here and there is no jsdom, so a stateful island cannot be clicked.
