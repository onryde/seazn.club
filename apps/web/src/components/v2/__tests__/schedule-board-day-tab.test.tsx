// The day tab after an Auto-schedule: the board must show the day it just
// filled, not the day it was looking at before.
//
// THE BUG. `const [day, setDay] = useState(days[0]); if (!day) setDay(days[0])`
// captured the tab at FIRST render and could never re-derive it: the pinned
// value is a non-empty string, so the `!day` escape hatch is dead. On an empty
// board `days` is `[dayKey(cfg.startAt)]` (or today), so a solver run that
// placed the matches on any other date left `day` naming a day the board no
// longer has. `dayFixtures` filters to nothing, `BoardGrid` draws an empty
// grid, and nothing downstream of the RSC refresh ever looks at the tab again —
// the organiser reads "no matches" over a board that is in fact fully placed,
// and it does not self-correct.
//
// WHY THIS FILE AND NOT A STATIC RENDER. The bug is the transition, not either
// end of it: mounted directly at the second state the board is correct, so
// `renderToStaticMarkup` cannot express it. `renderIsland(...).rerender()`
// hands down fresh props the way an RSC refresh does while hook state carries
// over, which is exactly the shape of the failure.
//
// WHY IT ASSERTS THE OPPOSITE CASE TOO. The ‹ / › arrows deliberately step onto
// days that are NOT in `days` — an organiser scrubbing an empty date is a
// feature. A fix that simply snapped `day` back into `days` on every render
// would delete that, and would still pass the first test here. So the second
// test drives the real arrow handler and pins that the empty day it chose
// survives the next render.
