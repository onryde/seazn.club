// Task 12 — the Polish button, and what the three schedule actions actually
// POST.
//
// The board's three buttons all reach the same endpoint and differ only in the
// body, so the wiring is the whole feature: a Polish button that posts
// `mode: "reflow"` renders identically, passes every render assertion, and runs
// the wrong solver. There is no DOM here (vitest `environment: "node"`, no
// jsdom), so the board is mounted through the shared hook harness and each
// button is fired through its own `onClick` — the production handler, not a
// re-implementation of it.
//
// All three are asserted together on purpose. `mode` is absent on two of them
// and present on one, and a mutation that stamped every call with the same
// value would satisfy any spec that only ever looked at one button.
