// `usecases/__tests__/history.test.ts` pins that `createCheckpoint` RETURNS an
// `evicted` field. Nothing there says the organiser is ever told. A save that
// silently drops a bookmark is the whole failure mode this change is supposed
// to avoid, so the join between the API's answer and the sentence on screen
// needs its own witness.
//
// A static `renderToStaticMarkup` cannot reach it: the notice only exists AFTER
// a submit, so this drives the real island — state, effects, the English
// catalog, the output tree — through the shared hook harness.
