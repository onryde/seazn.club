// Regression (2026-07-14): a pure League division has ONE stage. The Delete
// affordance was gated on `stages.length > 1`, so the only stage never showed
// Delete — yet the server's deleteStage happily removes the last/only stage
// when nothing is played. Result: once fixtures were generated, the format
// lock ("delete the stages first") had no escape. The button must appear for
// a single unplayed stage, and must NOT appear once a fixture is played.
