// Task 12 item 4 — "Auto-schedule remaining" reports its run too.
//
// The stages panel holds the SECOND call site for POST /stages/{id}/schedule/auto
// (v3/04 §3 item 3, fired from the pinned unscheduled section). Task 9 populates
// `metrics` and `solver` on every response, so this entry point already receives
// the solver's report and drops it on the floor: the same run, launched from the
// board, explains itself in full; launched from here it says "Placed 6 matches"
// and nothing about what the solver could not do.
//
// That asymmetry is the defect. An organiser who reaches auto-schedule from the
// division page has no way to learn that four cards went unplaced or that the
// run ran out of time — the numbers are on the wire and nothing renders them.
//
// No DOM here (vitest `environment: "node"`), so the panel is mounted through
// the shared hook harness and the CTA is fired through its own `onClick`.
