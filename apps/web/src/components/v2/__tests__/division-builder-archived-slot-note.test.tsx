// The divisions paywall names its invisible cause (#376 part D, task 8).
//
// Since V354 an archived division with recorded results keeps its
// `divisions.per_competition.max` slot. The console hides archived divisions,
// so an org can be looking at ONE division and a "you are at your limit"
// gate — arithmetic that is simply wrong from the reader's side, with no way
// to discover why short of contacting support.
//
// This drives the wizard's real submit path with a mocked transport, makes the
// server refuse with the 402 the server actually sends, and asserts the
// explaining sentence appears — and that it appears ONLY when the archived
// slots are what tipped the limit over, and ONLY for this feature key. An
// explanation attached to a refusal it does not explain is a wrong answer,
// not a redundant one.
//
// "Are they the cause?" is a server question rather than a count (#376 part C
// review): at a cap of four with four VISIBLE divisions and one archived
// holder the count is non-zero and the archive is still irrelevant — releasing
// it would change nothing. So the component takes the ANSWER,
// `archivedSlotsExplainRefusal`, and the arithmetic behind it is proved
// against a real 402 in usecases/__tests__/division-slot-disclosure.test.ts.
