// Event Pass state for the competition currently in view (v3/07 §3, v17 #301).
//
// The competition layout resolves every fact a gate needs ONCE per request —
// does a `competition_passes` row exist for this competition and at which rung,
// is the org on a paid plan, what currency does it buy in, and (if a row
// exists) WHY the pass has stopped applying if it has — and provides them here,
// so every gate under /o/[orgSlug]/c/[compSlug] reads an answer instead of
// issuing its own query. Client islands (UpgradeGate and friends) cannot query
// Postgres at all, which is the other half of why this crosses the RSC boundary
// as plain props.
//
// The default is deliberately the ABSENT/SAFE value on all of them: org-level
// pages have no competition in scope and never mount this provider, and a gate
// there must keep behaving exactly as it does today (offer Pro, no "already
// owned" state). Making the absent case indistinguishable from "community org,
// no pass" means an island can call the hooks unconditionally, wherever it
// renders.
//
// NOTE: pass presence is about the ROW EXISTING, never about payment.
// `competition_passes.stripe_payment_intent` is nullable — a staff-granted pass
// carries no intent and is fully active. Nothing downstream may filter on it.

 *   redundant: every key the pass lifts, the paid matrix lifts further, so
 *   offering it sells the customer less than they already hold.
 * - `closed` — the competition is past the line where a pass may be sold at
