// Shared player-stat labelling (PROMPT-65 → /me reuse): a snapshot's raw
// counters become display rows via the sport module's DECLARED playerStats
// model — metrics, derived, then awards (suffixed _awards in snapshots) —
// never hardcoded labels. Zero-valued rows are dropped; a retired module
// build yields [] so callers skip the block instead of breaking the page.
//
// The module's DECLARED label is English, and that is the whole reason this
// helper takes a translator: the public player page and /me have never LOOKED
// unlocalized, because "Goals" and "Balls faced" always rendered. `m` is
// REQUIRED — an optional one would let a new caller silently ship English —
// and it resolves per-sport copy (`stat.<sportKey>.<metricKey>`), falling back
// to the module's own label for a metric this app has no key for yet.
