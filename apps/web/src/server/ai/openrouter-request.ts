 *  object inside ANOTHER message's `content` field —
 *  `{role:"assistant", content: {role,content,reasoning_details}}` — which
 *  OpenRouter rejects (`content` must be a string or content-part array, not
 *  an object): verified live 2026-07-21, a real repair round on
 *  `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` after ~340s of round-1 generation —
 *  `messages.2.content: Invalid input` (HTTP 400). When an assistant turn's
 *  content IS that raw message shape, use it directly as the wire message
 *  instead of re-wrapping it. A plain user turn's content is always a string
 *  (schedule-ai.ts sends `JSON.stringify(...)`), so it is untouched here. */

/** OpenRouter's strict `json_schema` mode (as enforced on the Anthropic
 *  first-party route, at minimum) rejects numeric/array bound keywords
 *  outright. Verified live 2026-07-21 against `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`,
 *  two distinct rejections:
 *    - `output_config.format.schema: For 'array' type, property 'maxItems'
 *      is not supported` (request_id `req_011CdFj2ythzm8q8drnCah8F`) — from
 *      `AiSchedulePlan`'s `.max()` on `assignments`/`assumptions`
 *      (schedule-ai-prompt.ts).
 *    - `output_config.format.schema: For 'integer' type, properties maximum,
 *      minimum are not supported` (request_id `req_011CdFjaCFxkqpqrJEH8BysU`)
 *      — from `restMin`/`restByGroup`'s `.nonnegative()` on
 *      `SchedulingConstraints` (packages/engine/src/scheduling/constraints.ts),
 *      reached via `AiConstraintDelta = SchedulingConstraints.partial()`.
 *    - `output_config.format.schema: For 'object' type, property
 *      'propertyNames' is not supported` (request_id
 *      `req_011CdFjiYZKZ5oumqKtT66w6`) — from `restByGroup`'s
 *      `z.record(z.string(), ...)`, whose JSON Schema form constrains the
 *      record's keys with `propertyNames`.
 *  All three are zod-derived bounds `z.toJSONSchema` turns into JSON Schema
 *  keywords the vendor won't accept — so EVERY structured-output call
 *  through this adapter failed before this fix, for every model, independent
 *  of which candidate was being tested. Strip the whole bound-keyword family
 *  recursively rather than changing the zod schemas themselves:
 *  `AiSchedulePlan.safeParse()` in schedule-ai.ts still enforces every bound
 *  on the response, so this only drops a wire-level hint the vendor can't
 *  accept, not the enforcement. */
