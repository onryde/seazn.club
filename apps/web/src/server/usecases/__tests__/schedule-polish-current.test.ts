// Task 12 / ruling R20 — POLISH anchors to the ORGANISER'S board, not to one
// greedy invented during the run.
//
// The engine half landed first: `BuildInput.current` is the caller's own board,
// `moved` is measured against it when it is supplied, `lost` counts baseline
// rows the run could not place (R21), and a `frozen` id with no `locked` anchor
// is pinned to its `current` slot rather than to greedy's re-placement. All of
// that is inert until a caller supplies the field, and `autoSchedule` is the
// only caller there is — so without these specs the whole ruling ships as dead
// code that passes its own package's tests.
//
// WHAT MAKES THE FIXTURE HERE THE TEST. Every assertion below is on a board the
// organiser MOVED away from the solver's own answer (a uniform +3h shift after
// an apply). On a board that happens to be greedy's board, `movedFrom(current)`
// and `movedFrom(greedy seed)` return the same number and the specs would pass
// against either baseline while measuring the wrong one. The measured pair is
// recorded on each spec.
//
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL.

 * that arrived carrying blocking conflicts would change what the run does for

 *
 * C1 fix-loop (G2/3rd instance). The per-fixture loop below moves ONE card at
 * a time (`patchFixture` → `moveFixture`), so mid-loop the board is a MIX of
 * shifted and not-yet-shifted cards — a real, if transient, board state, not
 * a fiction. Processed in DESCENDING original-time order (latest first) so
 * every intermediate state stays chronologically consistent with the final
 * one: the card being shifted right now is, by construction, at or after
 * every not-yet-shifted (still-original-position) card and, after its own
 * `+minutes` move, still at or after every already-shifted one (the same
 * constant added to both sides of an already-true `<=` preserves it). Shifted
 * in `built.assignments`' own (solver) order instead, a round-1 card could
 * jump `minutes` STRAIGHT PAST a not-yet-shifted round-2/3 sibling still
 * sitting at its original, much-earlier position — a genuine, if short-lived,
 * round-order violation the delta gate's own round-robin blind spot (this
 * task's fix) could not see before. Only proven for a FORWARD shift (this
 * file's only direction); a backward one would need ASCENDING order instead.
