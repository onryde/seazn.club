// The auto pass must not hold a database transaction across the solve —
// z3's, for BUILD/POLISH historically, or the placement service's gRPC round
// trip, which is what BUILD/POLISH and (since C4, 2026-08-14, z3 retirement
// stage A) REFLOW all use now.
//
// THE HAZARD. `withTenant` pins a pooled connection for the whole of its
// callback. Before the solver wave the in-transaction work was a synchronous
// `slotFixtures` pass — microseconds. It is now up to `AUTO_SOLVER_WALL_MS` of
// solving (a network round trip to the placement service, or — historically,
// pre-C4, for REFLOW — a `resetZ3()` that must first queue behind any
// concurrent solve's `withZ3Lock`). A solve inside the transaction is
// therefore tens of seconds of idle-in-transaction per organiser click, and a
// handful of concurrent clicks exhausts the pool and stalls database traffic
// for the whole application — an outage reached from a feature that "works"
// in every functional test.
//
// WHY THIS IS A STRUCTURAL ASSERTION AND NOT A TIMING ONE. "The transaction was
// short" is a claim about a machine, not about the code: it passes on an idle
// laptop and flakes on a loaded CI box, and this repo already carries one
// wall-clock assertion that flakes for exactly that reason. So the test observes
// the SHAPE instead — it counts open `withTenant` frames and records the depth
// the solver was entered at. Depth 0 is the property; anything else means the
// solve is nested inside a transaction, however fast it happened to be.
//
// Both module mocks spread the real module, so everything except the two
// wrappers is the genuine implementation and the reads below hit a real
// Postgres.
