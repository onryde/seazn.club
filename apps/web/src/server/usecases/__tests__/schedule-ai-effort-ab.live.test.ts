  // google/gemini-3.6-flash is rung 1 of DEFAULT_LADDER (schedule-ai.ts:2366),
  // so it is what production actually runs wherever OPENROUTER_API_KEY is set.
  // gemini-3.7-flash is its successor at HALF the output rate — $1.875 vs
  // $3.75 per Mtok, verified live 2026-08-16 against /models — on the same
  // `google-vertex` slug, so it needs no allowlist change and no new
  // sub-processor. Output tokens are ~96% of a run's cost, so if 3.7 holds
  // plan quality this halves the architect bill outright.
  //
  // The incumbent is re-run in the SAME session rather than compared against
  // the 2026-07-21 STAGE3 numbers: those were a different pack revision and a
  // different draft path (STAGE5 changed bracket-16 to a realistic greedy
  // draft), so cross-session numbers are not a control.
  //
  // Both arms, all three packs, effort high, 32k default. n via AI_AB_REPEATS.
  // Enable with AI_AB_SHOOTOUT_STAGE6=1.
