// What a card that is NOT on the REFLOW answer is told about itself.
//
// `reflowExisting`'s `settle` carries the web layer's own copy of the engine's
// conflict-source rule: `validateAssignments` answers for the rows it is handed
// and cannot report an ABSENCE, so every movable fixture missing from the
// proposal needs a reason, and there are two sources — greedy's own diagnosis
// first, a bare `no_slot` only if greedy said nothing. The ORDER is right. The
// FILTER on the first source was not, and it is the same defect the engine
// fixed in a5b2c4d7.
//
// `seed.conflicts` is not "what greedy could not do". `slotFixtures` also files
// rows about cards it DID place — the `commit` person-overlap loop, and the
// clash it reports rather than fixes when a `locked` slot collides — and source
// 1 short-circuits the one below it. So a card greedy PLACED and something
// later removed was handed a placed card's conflict: an overlap describing the
// placement greedy had just made, rather than the fact that the card is now on
// nobody's timetable. `person_overlap` is BLOCKING, so the organiser is also
// shown a reason their board cannot be applied for a card that is not on it.
//
// WHY THIS FILE MOCKS. Two inputs are needed and today's code can produce
// neither on its own, which is the same argument `schedule-reflow-lost.test.ts`
// makes for its own mock:
//
//   * a greedy row about a card greedy placed. `reflowExisting` seeds only
//     `f.locked === undefined` fixtures, so the locked-clash row is out of
//     reach, and `personBlocked` is unconditional in the free-placement loop,
//     so the `commit` overlap row cannot fire either. The shape is reachable in
//     `buildSchedule` (which seeds pins) and is one lock-mode change away from
//     being reachable here.
//   * a card dropped between the seed and `settle`. `repairSchedule` is TOTAL
//     over the proposal on every return path, so only a mock can remove one —
//     measured and documented in `schedule-reflow-lost.test.ts`.
//
// Everything else is real: a real Postgres, a real greedy seed, a real z3
// repair, and the real `settle`.
//
// BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE ASSERTED. The narrowing must not turn a genuine greedy
// diagnosis into a bare `no_slot` — the binding constraint greedy names is the
// best answer anybody has for a card that was never placed — so the second
// fixture below is absent from the seed WITH a diagnosis, and must still be
// told it. That half passes before and after the fix, deliberately: it is the
// guard on the fix, not the proof of it.
