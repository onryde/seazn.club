// #462 — a sibling division's fixtures carry their RULE IDENTITY, not just
// their court time.
//
// `siblingAssignments` returned `Assignment[]`, a shape that structurally cannot
// carry `extKey` or `winnerTo`. The engine's day-cap tally counts only the
// `existing` rows it can NAME —
//
//     existing.filter((e) => fixtureById.has(e.fixtureId))          calendar.ts
//
// where `fixtureById` is built from `config.ruleFixtures`. Every board path in
// `schedule.ts` built `ruleFixtures` from THIS division's rows alone, so a
// sibling's card was on the board as occupancy and invisible to every typed
// rule. A competition-scoped `max_fixtures_per_day` therefore undercounted by
// exactly the number of sibling fixtures on the day — silently, and in the
// direction that says "this board is fine".
//
// WHY THE NUMBER IS THE ASSERTION. "A conflict was reported" is satisfied by an
// undercount that still breaches the cap; only the count distinguishes 3-on-the-
// day from 2. Every board below is therefore built so the cap is breached ONLY
// once the sibling is counted: two of this division's fixtures against a 2/day
// cap is legal on its own.
//
// FOUR call sites take siblings, and a missed one is exactly this defect again.
// Three are exercised here — `validateSchedule` (the board report),
// `applySchedule` (the write gate) and `autoSchedule` (the placer). The fourth,
// `moveFixture`, returns no conflicts to assert on until #461; it is covered in
// `schedule-move-conflicts.test.ts`.
//
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL.
