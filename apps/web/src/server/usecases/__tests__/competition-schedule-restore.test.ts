// #386 — restoreCompetitionSchedule: undo ONE joint apply from the server.
//
// `applyCompetitionSchedule` writes every selected division in one transaction;
// the undo was a CLIENT loop over the per-division restore (`ai-joint-apply.ts`),
// so a closed tab part-way through left half the board carrying the AI schedule
// and half carrying the old one. This suite pins the server-side twin.
//
// What it is NOT: atomic. `restoreCheckpoint` rewinds by appending inverse
// events, each its own transaction, deliberately (history.ts:379). The
// guarantees under test are instead (a) the division set is validated against
// the apply event rather than trusted, (b) a per-division failure is REPORTED,
// not swallowed and not allowed to abort the divisions after it, and (c) a
// joint apply that lands mid-rewind is DETECTED by the anchor recheck, which
// stops the loop with a truthful partial report.
//
// THE SEED IS DELIBERATELY ASYMMETRIC (Alpha 4 entrants -> 6 fixtures, Bravo 3
// -> 3): two identically-sized divisions cannot tell a real per-division
// restore from the first division's result repeated.
//
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL.

/**
 * TWO one-shot seams, and NOTHING else is mocked: both wrappers delegate to the

 * unset — all but two — exercises the unmocked path.
 *
 * They exist because the interleaving under test cannot be produced by timing.
 * A joint apply has to commit INSIDE the rewind loop, in the gap the anchor
 * recheck watches; a seeded two-division rewind takes milliseconds end to end,
 * so racing a real apply against it would be a coin toss that reports green
 * whichever way it lands. The event these hooks insert is a real
 * `schedule.applied_multi` row written the way a committed joint apply leaves
 * one — only the MOMENT is made deterministic.
 *
 *  - `afterFirstRead` fires when the usecase's first transaction commits: the
 *    anchor read. That lands an apply BEFORE the first division's recheck.
 *  - `afterFirstRewind` fires when the first `restoreCheckpoint` returns, i.e.
 *    between two iterations of the loop.
