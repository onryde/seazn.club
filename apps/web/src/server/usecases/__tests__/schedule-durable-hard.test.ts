// #447 — a durable `constraints.hard` rule must reach the verifier on the board
// paths, not only on the AI one.
//
// WHAT THE DEFECT WAS. `toSlotConfig` copied every field of the durable
// `constraints` object except `hard`, and a `SlotConfig` is structurally
// assignable to a `VerifyConfig` with `tz`, `hard`, `ruleFixtures` and
// `restByDivision` all `undefined`. So all four board call sites handed
// `validateAssignments` a config that type-checked perfectly and carried no
// typed rule at all. `effectiveHard`'s own docstring calls a rule that binds on
// one entry point and not the other "the worst kind".
//
// WHY THESE TESTS BUILD THE CONFIG WITH THE REAL BUILDER. The engine suite
// already proves the verifier honours `hard`: `calendar-instruction.test.ts`
// hand-writes `hard: [...]` into a `VerifyConfig` literal. That literal is
// exactly what the product never produced — it bypasses the one function that
// dropped the field — so a literal-based test here would score zero. Everything
// below goes through `ScheduleConfig.parse` (the durable schema, the same one
// `loadSettings` uses on the stored jsonb) and then through `toVerifyConfig`.
//
// No database: every builder under test is pure. The DB round trip through
// `putScheduleSettings` and the four surfaces lives in
// `schedule-durable-hard-surfaces.test.ts`.
