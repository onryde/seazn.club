// #230 item 2 — the server-side final validation gate at publish.
//
// `publishSchedule` used to advance the division and append `schedule_published`
// after counting the fixtures that carried a `scheduled_at`. A count is not a
// check: the board's conflicts panel is client-side and advisory, so a board that
// was valid when the organiser last looked could be published broken after a
// settings change, a new blackout, an entrant withdrawal or a cross-division edit.
//
// The gate runs the SAME validator the panel runs (`validateScheduleIn`), inside
// publish's own transaction and AFTER its advisory lock, so nothing can land
// between the check and the event.
//
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL.
