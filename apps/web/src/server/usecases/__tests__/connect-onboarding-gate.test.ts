//
// which was dead code twice over. `registration.paid` is TRUE on the community
// matrix since V310 (D19), so the plan row already satisfies the gate and the
// escape can never be what lets an org through; and the one thing that CAN
// still deny it — an org_entitlement_overrides row, written when staff suspend
// paid intake for abuse or chargeback risk — beats a pass everywhere else in
// the app (lib/entitlements.ts folds the override over the pass with
// `ov.bool_value ?? base`, so a non-null false short-circuits). Skipping the
// gate on the mere PRESENCE of a pass row therefore turned a staff deny into
// something an org could walk around for $29.
//
// Connect is org-level plumbing — one connected account for the whole org — so
// this gate is deliberately org-wide and NOT competition-scoped. That is also
// why the pass-scoping guard does not list it: `registration.paid` is not a
// lifted key. Nothing else would force this, hence these two cases.
//
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL. Seeds are run-unique.
