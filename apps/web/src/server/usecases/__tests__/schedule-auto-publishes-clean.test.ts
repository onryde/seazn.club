// THE AUTO PASS PRODUCES A BOARD THE PUBLISH GATE ACCEPTS UNACKNOWLEDGED.
//
// Nothing else in the branch says this. `schedule-publish-gate.test.ts` drives
// hand-placed boards, and the e2e board spec publishes with
// `acknowledge_warnings: true` — correctly, because the fixtures it publishes
// have been moved, pinned and re-flowed by the tests ahead of it in its serial
// chain, so a rest shortfall there is fair game. But that override means no
// surface in the branch still proves the auto pass yields a warning-free board:
// a regression that made every auto board breach the rest floor would stay
// green everywhere.
//
// This is that proof, end to end on a real database: settings with a live rest
// floor → generate → `autoSchedule` → `applySchedule` → `publishSchedule` with
// NO acknowledgement. Nothing hand-places a card, so what publishes is exactly
// what the solver produced.
//
// THE FLOOR HAS TO BE LIVE, or this is a test about nothing. The second case
// hand-places the SAME entrants on the SAME settings with a 30-minute
// turnaround and shows the gate refusing it with `warn.rest` — so the first
// case's clean publish is the solver honouring the floor, not the gate being
// asleep.
