// Phase 2 pass-scoping sweep — `exports.branded` on the competition timetable.
//
// usecases/exports.ts `orgBranding` resolved `exports.branded` ORG-WIDE while
// holding the competition id in its own parameter list (it hands that same id
// to resolveSponsors two lines later). lib/entitlements.ts only consults
// competition_passes when a competition is in scope, so a community org that
// bought an Event Pass got an UNBRANDED pdf for the very competition it paid
// to brand — the grant was invisible to the resolver.
//
// The matrix makes this a real separation, not a coincidence:
//   exports.branded  community=false  event_pass=true
// so a passed competition must brand and an unpassed one in the SAME org must
// not. Both directions are asserted; a one-sided test would still pass if the
// gate leaked org-wide, which is the other half of the bug.
//
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL. Seeds are run-unique.
