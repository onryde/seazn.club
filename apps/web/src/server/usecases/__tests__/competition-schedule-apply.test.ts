// #350 Task 6 — applyCompetitionSchedule acceptance: ONE transaction writes
// every selected division's assignments, or none of them.
//
// Everything in this product's apply path is single-division today (one
// advisory lock, one seq assertion, one seq bump), and the board orchestrates a
// multi-division apply by calling the per-stage endpoint in a loop — so a
// failure halfway through leaves half the board written. Spec §8 requires the
// opposite, and "a stale expected_seq on the SECOND division rolls back the
// FIRST" is the test that can tell the two apart.
//
// THE SEED IS DELIBERATELY ASYMMETRIC (Alpha 6 fixtures, Bravo 3): two
// identically-sized divisions cannot distinguish per-division data from
// first-division-wins.
//
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL.
