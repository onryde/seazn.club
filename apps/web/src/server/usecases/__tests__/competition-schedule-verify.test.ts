// #350 Task 3 — the JOINT VERIFIER. Pure: hand-built CompetitionPack fixtures,
// no DB, no SDK, no network.
//
// What is under test is one design decision. `validateAssignments` takes ONE
// scalar config — one matchMinutes, one gapMinutes, one blackouts[], one
// sessionWindows[] — and divisions legitimately differ on every one of them.
// Merging them into a "strictest" config would silently apply division A's
// session window to division B's fixtures, so `verifyJoint` instead runs one
// pass PER DIVISION with that division's own config, handing the other
// divisions' proposed slots in as `existing`. Every test below that names two
// divisions with different settings is a guard on that: a merged-config
// implementation gives a visibly different answer to each of them.
//
// NEUTRALISATION IS DELIBERATE. `validateAssignments` reports court, rest,
// blackout, session-window, person and order conflicts from one call, so an
// assertion that only counts conflicts proves nothing about WHICH rule fired.
// Every seed here therefore zeroes the constraints it is not testing — the
// cross-person test puts its two fixtures on DIFFERENT courts with zero rest
// and no blackouts, so the only thing that can produce its conflict is the
// person check.

// `competition-schedule-apply.ts`'s joint apply calls `verifyConfigFor` with no
// `rules` bundle at all, by design (#399: apply-time blocking must not extend
// to the typed-rule families — see the `rules` param's own doc comment a few
// hundred lines up in competition-schedule-ai.ts). That left the round-order
// scan permanently inert there too, since it needs `config.tz` and the apply
// path never supplied one. This 4th parameter closes that gap by carrying
// `tz` ALONE, independent of `rules` — mirroring the existing `window`
// parameter's shape exactly (also apply-only, also deliberately excluded from
// `rules`).
//
// What makes this safe rather than a re-opening of #399 in disguise:
// `effectiveHard` (calendar.ts) merges `config.hard` with
// `config.constraints?.hard`, and `buildEngineConstraints` — the ONE builder
// this function feeds `constraints` through, unconditionally, `rules` or not —
// NEVER populates `.hard` under `AI_VERIFY_POLICY` (`hard: false`,
// engine-constraints.ts:123). So `effectiveHard(config)` is provably `[]` at
// every call site that reaches `verifyConfigFor` without an explicit `rules`
// bundle, REGARDLESS of this parameter — `validateInstructionRules`'s entire
// typed-rule block (calendar.ts ~1043) loops over that empty array and does
// nothing. The round-order scan (calendar.ts ~1535) is the ONLY consumer of
// `config.tz` that reads no other `VerifyConfig` field, which is exactly why
// it is the one thing this parameter can switch on.
