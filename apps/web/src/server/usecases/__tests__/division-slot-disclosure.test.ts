//
// Both are answered by `division_has_results(...)`, the SAME SQL function the

// cannot drift: the disclosure is only worth shipping if it predicts the
// charge, and a warning that says "this is free" while the quota bills for it
// is worse than the silence it replaces. So the last case does not assert on
// the helper at all — it asserts that a non-zero count is followed by a real
// 402 from `createDivision`, and that a zero count is followed by a create
// that succeeds.
