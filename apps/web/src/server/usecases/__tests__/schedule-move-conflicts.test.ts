// #461 — a move returns the conflicts it already computed.
//
// `moveFixture` builds a full conflict report for the destination slot, uses it
// for `assertNoNewBlocking`, and then throws it away: the function was
// `Promise<void>`. Blocking conflicts 409, so an organiser hears about those.
// WARN-level ones — rest shortfalls, a stored typed rule, a session-window
// breach — were computed and dropped on the floor, so an API client dragging a
// card was told nothing at all about the board it had just created.
//
// THE BOARD BELOW ALSO COVERS #462's FOURTH CALL SITE. `moveFixture` is one of
// the four places sibling assignments reach the verifier, and it was the one
// site whose fix could not be asserted while the function returned nothing. The
// cap here is competition-scoped and breaks ONLY once the sibling division's
// card is counted, so a regression in either fix reds this file.
//
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL.
