// #230 item 2, follow-up — the publish gate was walkable around via "Start".
//
// `publishSchedule` validates the board before it goes public. `startDivision`
// did not validate anything at all: it advanced `setup → active`, and on the
// quick-start path it WROTE rolling round times itself and then opened scoring
// (`scoring.ts` opens on `active`). So an organiser whose board failed the
// publish gate could simply press Start instead and the same broken timetable
// went live, with no `schedule_published` event to record that it ever had.
//
// The owner's design is not a second refusal but a second CALLER: starting the
// tournament auto-publishes the schedule, under the same validation, the same
// error codes and the same `acknowledge_warnings` contract, so the console's
// confirm dialog serves both buttons with one code path.
//
// Two properties this file exists to pin, both of which a plausible
// implementation gets wrong:
//
//   * the gate rejects CONFLICTS, never INCOMPLETENESS. Many existing suites
//     start divisions whose boards are empty or half-slotted; an empty board
//     yields no assignments, so `validateAssignments` — which reports only on
//     `assignments`, never on `existing` — has nothing to report. If that ever
//     stops being true, this file reds before those suites do.
//   * on the quick-start path the check runs AFTER the rolling times are
//     written. Validating first checks a board that does not exist yet.
//
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL.
