// The per-ORG cooldown on the auto pass (AUTO_SCHEDULE_COOLDOWN).
//
// WHAT IT PROTECTS. `autoSchedule` had no rate limit at all, and its per-call
// cost went from a sub-millisecond greedy pass to up to `AUTO_SOLVER_WALL_MS`
// (20s) of solving. When this limit was written that solve was SERIALISED
// across the whole process by a z3 lock, so one organiser clicking repeatedly
// stalled every other org on that instance. The solver is out-of-process now
// and the lock went with it, but the limit still bounds how much work a
// single tenant can queue against it. So one authenticated organiser clicking
// repeatedly still degrades the shared queue for everyone else on it.
//
// The key is the ORG, not the instance: the failure mode is one tenant
// monopolising a shared serialised queue, and a global limiter would refuse
// the victims along with the offender.
//
// WHY THE CACHE IS MOCKED. `rateLimit` is backed solely by Upstash, and
// `incrWindow` returns null when no REDIS_URL is configured — which is every
// local run, every worktree and CI. The limiter is INERT there and allows
// unconditionally, so a test that simply called `autoSchedule` eleven times
// would pass with the limiter deleted. The counter has to be real for any
// assertion here to mean anything, so `incrWindow` is mocked and `cacheGet` and
// friends are spread through untouched (entitlement resolution runs on them).
//
// NON-VACUITY. A `rejects 429` on its own cannot tell a LIMIT from a COUNTER
// that fires after the expensive work: both refuse the eleventh call, and only
// one of them saved the solver. So every case here also asserts whether the
// engine was ENTERED — `solver.entered` must not advance on the refused call,
// and must advance on the allowed one, or the "allowed" case is proving nothing
// about a path that reaches the solver at all.
