// #447 — the DURABLE half: a `constraints.hard` rule written through the API,
// read back off `schedule_settings.config` jsonb, and enforced on every non-AI
// surface.
//
// The sibling file (`schedule-durable-hard.test.ts`) pins the builders. This one
// pins the product: the rule is PERSISTED by `putScheduleSettings`, re-parsed by
// `loadSettings`, and then each of the four board entry points is driven for
// real against Postgres. Nothing here constructs a config — that is the point.
// Every engine test injects `hard` straight into a `VerifyConfig` literal, which
// bypasses the one function that dropped it, which is exactly why the suite was
// blind to this for a whole wave.
//
// WHY THE SPY. All four surfaces now RETURN their conflicts — `moveFixture` did
// not until #461, and its list was the thing this spy existed to reach. The spy
// stays because it proves something the return value cannot: WHICH config each
// surface handed the engine. A config missing `hard`, `tz` or `ruleFixtures`
// binds nothing, and "no conflicts" is what a correctly-clean board looks like
// too, so the absence of a conflict can never distinguish the two. The drag
// path below now asserts BOTH — the config that went in and the report that
// came back.
//
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL (CI runs them).
