// Payments-hardening Task 10 (P2-10, decision §6.1): a Stripe-fee registration
// division must stop taking cards the moment the org loses the paid layer.
//
// An org can lose `registration.paid` WITHOUT touching Connect. Connect stays
// live (charges_enabled=true), so the pre-existing charges_enabled gate does
// NOT fire; money would keep landing on an entitlement the org no longer holds.
// The intake READ therefore also gates on the entitlement itself
// (`publicRegistrationInfo` → payments_unavailable, pinned below).
//
// V310 (D19) narrowed WHEN that happens without changing the gate. Charging an
// entry fee is now free on every plan, so a downgrade to community no longer
// revokes it — asserted directly below, because that is the behaviour change.
// The surviving revocation path is a staff `org_entitlement_overrides` deny
// (abuse, chargeback risk), and that is what the RED cases here use.
//
// RS001 registration demolition (#588): the SUBMIT-side 402 gate this file
// used to pin died with `submitRegistration` — see the comment inside the
// describe block below. Only the read-side gate has coverage here now.
//
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL. Seeds are run-unique
// (randomUUID). The Stripe seam is stubbed but currently unused by any
// surviving test — left in place as harmless setup.
