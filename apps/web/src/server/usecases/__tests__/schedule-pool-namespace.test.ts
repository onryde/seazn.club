// #449 — ONE pool namespace at the engine boundary.
//
// `Assignment.poolId` used to be a pool UUID on the board path and a pool KEY
// ('A', 'B') on the AI path, and `RuleFixture.poolId` carried the key on both.
// `scopeCoversFixture` reads `f?.poolId ?? a.poolId`, so the RuleFixture value
// MASKS the assignment's — meaning that whatever namespace an organiser's
// stored rule was authored in, at most ONE of the two paths could ever bind it.
// The same split reached `effectiveRestMinutes`' `restByGroup` lookup, which is
// keyed on the same field.
//
// The UUID is canonical: it is what the board path already used, what the DB
// stores, and what `restByGroup` keys are authored against. A pool key is
// display metadata and is not even unique across divisions.
//
// WHY THIS FILE COMPARES TWO PATHS RATHER THAN ASSERTING ONE. A namespace split
// is invisible from inside either half — each is self-consistent, and a test
// that hands the engine two equal strings passes while proving nothing. Only
// running the SAME division, the SAME stored rules and the SAME board through
// both real builders and demanding the same verdict can catch it. So every
// assertion below is a comparison, and the fixed values are only there to stop
// "both paths report nothing" from counting as agreement.
