// The staff escape hatch for V354's slot rule.
//
// A division's quota slot is spent by RECORDED RESULTS and the rule has NO
// timer, by design: any window long enough to close the archive-and-recreate
// loop is short enough to punish an honest mistake. So an org that burns a slot
// by genuine accident — one stray recorded result on a division it then
// archives — gets a SUPPORT PATH rather than a loophole. Staff-only, and
// audited, because it moves an entitlement boundary for a paying customer.
//
// The staff assertion lives in the USE CASE, not only at the route: this is the
// one admin action whose refusal is part of the contract under test, and a
// route-only guard can only be exercised through a Next request. Non-staff is
// 403 (the caller IS authenticated and is being refused), not `requireStaff`'s
// 401.
