// W5 (#400) Task 2 — the run reuses the confirmed compile, or refuses.
//
// The preview (Task 1) showed the organiser what their sentence compiled into.
// This suite pins what the RUN then does with that confirmation, and every
// assertion here is about something that would otherwise be invisible:
//
//   * a confirmed preview means the run compiles ZERO times. Not "the run
//     succeeded" — the parse-call COUNT, because a second compile is a second
//     non-deterministic LLM answer, and the architect would then execute rules
//     the organiser never saw. That silent divergence is the entire failure this
//     wave exists to close, and only a count can catch it.
//   * a `preview_id` whose stored hash does not match the submitted instruction
//     is a 409 `preview_stale` with ZERO architect calls. Recompiling instead
//     would run — and CHARGE — under a confirmation given for a different
//     sentence.
//   * a preview is single-use. A double-submit off one confirmation must not
//     buy two runs.
//   * a preview from another org, another scope, or past its TTL is refused.
//     Cross-tenant reuse would be a security defect, not a bug.
//   * no `preview_id` compiles inline exactly as today, so smoke, e2e and every
//     external API consumer keep working unchanged.
//   * reuse does not consume a SECOND rate-limit token — the preview already
//     paid for it — while a run without one still consumes its own.
//
// Harness: the stage-1 compiler is replaced by a spy (so "compiles zero times"
// is countable and no compile ever reaches a network), the architect runs
// through a stubbed AiProvider, and the Redis window counter is an in-memory
// Map so the 429 path is genuinely exercised. Everything else — entitlements,
// credits, the pack builder, ai_parse_previews — is real Postgres.
