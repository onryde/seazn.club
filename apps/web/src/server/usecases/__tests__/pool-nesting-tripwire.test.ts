// `withTenant` is `getClient().begin()`, which PINS one pooled connection for
// the whole callback. Any query issued on the pooled `sql` proxy from inside
// that callback asks the SAME pool for a second connection while the first is
// still held. With the production pool (`max: 5`, lib/db.ts) five concurrent
// renders reaching such a line pin all five slots and queue for a sixth that
// can never exist. postgres.js has no queue-wait timeout, so the deadlock is
// PERMANENT: the process sits at ~0% CPU serving static routes 200 while every
// DB-touching route — `/api/health` included — hangs for ever. Observed live
// twice on 2026-08-05 (five connections per process `idle in transaction`,
// `wait_event=ClientRead`, no COMMIT ever sent).
//
// The guard here is a pool of ONE. At `max: 1` the same nesting deadlocks
// deterministically on a single call instead of only under five-way
// concurrency — no race, no load dependence — so a regression fails this test
// on the first run rather than in production one cold cache later.
//
// Adding a case: seed under the normal pool, then run the read path inside
// `withOneSlotPool`. Anything that must NOT nest a pooled query inside
// `withTenant` belongs here.
