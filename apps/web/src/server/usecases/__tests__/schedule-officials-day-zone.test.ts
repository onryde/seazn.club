// An official's blackout is a CALENDAR DAY, so the query that matches it to a
// fixture must bucket on the governing clock — `settings.orgTz` — and not on
// `settings.displayTz`.
//
// The two are different objects for a reason (`ScheduleSettingsOut`'s own
// docstring: "DISPLAY ONLY. Never use it to decide which calendar day something
// is on"), and they diverge exactly when a division carries the V305 venue
// override. `displayTz` is division-override → org → UTC; `orgTz` is org → UTC,
// deliberately ignoring the override so two divisions of one competition cannot
// disagree about what day it is.
//
// THE FIXTURE HERE MAKES THEM DISAGREE, which is the whole point: a test where
// the two zones match proves nothing, because every spelling passes it. Org is
// Europe/London, the division overrides to America/New_York, and the fixture is
// at 02:00Z on 10 August 2026 — 03:00 on the 10th in London, 22:00 on the NINTH
// in New York. So:
//
//   * an official blacked out on the 10th (the org's day) must raise
//     `warn.official_unavailable`; bucketing on the display zone silently misses
//     it, and since this branch promoted that warning from an advisory badge to
//     a publish-gate input, the gate passes a board it should have queried.
//   * an official blacked out on the 9th must raise NOTHING. Without this half
//     the first case is satisfied by a query that warns on every date.
