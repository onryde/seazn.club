// #387 — what happens when the TELEMETRY write itself fails.
//
// Separate from `ai-quote-mismatch.test.ts` on purpose: that suite drives the
// three real run paths against real Postgres, where the insert succeeds. The
// failure this file is about cannot be produced there — it needs the write to
// throw, which means mocking `withTenant`, which is incompatible with a suite
// whose other assertions read the rows back.
//
// Why it matters: all three call sites `await recordQuoteMismatch(...)` bare,
// and they sit inside functions whose outer wrapper re-throws once the credit
// is consumed. Before the catch inside the helper, a constraint or
// serialization error on this insert turned a PAID, SUCCESSFUL run into a 500 —
// the organiser lost the response to a plan they had already been charged for,
// caused by the very telemetry that exists to detect them being overcharged.
