// A finished competition does not grow (#376 branch, part D).
//
// `assertCompetitionNotFrozen` checks the over-quota freeze and says NOTHING
// about status, so a `completed` or `archived` competition still accepted new
// divisions. Not a quota leak — the per-competition cap still binds — but it
// made "completed" mean nothing, and it contradicted the very same competition
// being refused an Event Pass on the same seam.
//
// TERMINAL ONLY. `passLockReason` has two blocking-shaped arms and only one of
// them may block a WRITE: `past_ends_on` is routinely a stale end date on a
// competition still being played, which is why the pass chip points that
// organiser at the settings form rather than at next season. Blocking it would
// freeze a live competition over a typo. The pass line and the write line share
// a vocabulary, not a threshold — so the `past_ends_on` case below is the load-
// bearing one, and it is written to be genuinely long past grace (7 days) so a
// guard that merely tested `passLockReason(...) !== null` would red on it.
