// `pageBreaks=per_pitch` on scoresheets is meant to give an organiser one
// printed stack per court, to hand to each court's official.
//
// It never did. exportFixtures orders by stage/round, which interleaves courts
// on purpose — that is what parallel courts are for — and the old code broke a
// page "whenever the court changed" against that order. On a two-court day
// that is a break at almost every sheet, and no grouping at all.
//
// It also indexed `undecided[i]` by SECTION index while sections were built
// with `push(...fragment())`, so the moment a sport emitted two sections for a
// fixture the arrays desynchronised and courts were read off the wrong
// fixture. Only volleyball ships a bespoke sheet today and it emits one, so
// that one was latent rather than live.
// P9: groupByCourt keys on `court_id` (stable identity) and orders by
// `court_name`. The helper mints a deterministic id per court NAME so these
// cases read the same as before, while two same-named courts in different
// venues would still be distinct ids — the case name-keying used to merge.
