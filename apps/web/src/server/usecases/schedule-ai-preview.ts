// W5 (#400) — the parse-only preview that precedes an AI schedule run.
//
// Until now the organiser typed a sentence and the next thing that happened was
// a credit leaving the wallet. What their words had actually compiled into was
// only visible AFTER the architect had run against it. This endpoint splits
// that in two: it runs stage 1 (the instruction compile, W3/#398) and stops,
// returning the rules, the preferences, the wording nobody could compile and
// the readings the resolver had to pick. The run is a second, deliberate
// request.
//
// Three properties make that split honest, and each is asserted by
// __tests__/schedule-ai-preview.test.ts:
//
//   1. NOTHING IS SPENT. No `spendCredit`, no architect call. Walking away
//      costs the organiser nothing, which is the entire point — a confirm gate
//      that had already charged would be a receipt, not a gate.
//   2. UNPRICED IS NOT FREE. An org that cannot pay for the run this precedes is
//      refused HERE, with the run's own 402, before we spend our tokens
//      compiling for it. The bound is `minimumCredits`, never `balance > 0`: a
//      3-credit wallet and a 4-credit joint run walk straight through the
//      latter.
//   3. THE SPEND IS VISIBLE. The compile costs real output tokens outside any
//      credit budget, so it is stamped on the ledger under the SAME
//      `parse_tokens` / `parse_failed` field names a run stamps
//      (lib/ai-rung.ts RunMeterStamp) — one vocabulary, not two.
//
// The gate ORDER below mirrors `aiPlanForDivision` / `aiPlanForCompetition`
// deliberately: kill switch → paid gate → frozen → rate limit → affordability →
// compile. A preview that refused later than the run does would tell the
// organiser a run is possible and then refuse it at confirm; one that refused
// earlier would hide a run that would in fact have gone through.
//
// The rate-limit bucket is SHARED with the run, unchanged, because the preview
// IS the LLM call the limit exists to bound. A second bucket would double the
// abuse surface it was sized for (#391).

 *   * expired. Thirty minutes is short enough that the org clock cannot cross a
