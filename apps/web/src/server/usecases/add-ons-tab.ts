    //
    //   1. a staff `org_entitlement_overrides` row whose `int_value` is null,
    //      on ANY plan including `pro` — a comped group that is still billed
    //      monthly for the riders it holds; and
    //   2. the PLAN's own catalog row being unlimited — `enterprise`, whose
    //      `plan_entitlements` row for `orgs.max_owned` has had a NULL
    //      `int_value` since V393 (entitlements v18). The comment that used to
    //      sit here claimed no plan grants unlimited `orgs.max_owned`; that has
    //      been false since that migration.
    //
    // (It also answers null when the basis has no resolving org at all — a
    // group whose every organisation is soft-deleted. A rendered settings page
    // cannot reach that: the org it is rendering for is not soft-deleted.)
    //
    // Collapsing the two has cost real defects in both directions: reading it
    // as "the plan is unlimited" alone took the rider control away from a
    // comped Pro payer who was there to CANCEL, and reading it as "a staff
    // override" alone painted an enterprise group the Community upsell (W8 F1
    // and its review). A UI arm that means "no ceiling to sell against" must
    // pair it with `!addonAvailable`; see add-ons/page.tsx.
    //
    // For THIS field the distinction does not change the answer — an unlimited
    // receipt of either origin against a finite admission cap is a reduction —
    // so `capReduced` needs no plan test. Cause 1 additionally survives
    // dunning: that override outranks the plan row in `resolve()` (both caps
    // stay unlimited, nothing to report), while `groupOrgLimit`'s
    // every-org-suspended branch reads `plan_entitlements` directly and
    // explicitly loses per-org overrides. A suspended group with an unlimited
    // comp therefore has an unlimited receipt and a finite admission cap, which
    // is exactly what this arm is for.
