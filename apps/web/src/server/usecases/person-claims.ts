 * Shared core (code-review fix, 2026-08-30): revoke any prior open invite

 * inline bodies — the exact "two lookup paths drift" defect class this
 * codebase has hit before — and `createSystemClaimInvite`'s own copy ran the
 * two statements UNTRANSACTED when called with the pooled `sql` (every real
 * call site today), each auto-committing on its own. A concurrent sweep for
 * the SAME person could then interleave: caller A's revoke commits, caller
 * B's insert lands and commits, then caller A's OWN insert fails against
 * `person_claims_open_uq` — and because A's revoke had ALREADY committed
 * with nothing transactional to undo it, that failure (silently swallowed by
 * `maybeInviteClaim`'s catch, registrations.ts) could leave a still-open
 * invite from the LOSING side's own revoke with no replacement. One
 * transaction makes the pair atomic: a losing insert now rolls its own
 * revoke back too, so a race always leaves whichever invite the WINNING
 * caller wrote, never a gap. Callers pass whatever `db` they already hold
 * (a `Tx` already inside a transaction runs this directly, atomic with the
 * rest of it; the pooled `sql` is wrapped in its own transaction by the
 * caller — see createSystemClaimInvite below).
