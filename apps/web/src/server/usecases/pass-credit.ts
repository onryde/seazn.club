 * rule throughout is: **anything unproven yields no credit.** Under-crediting is

/* ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * §6 — STAFF RESOLUTION of an undetermined reversal (#305, #286 phase 2)
 *
 * V337 (phase 1) made the undetermined branch hold `pass_credit_redemptions_
 * group_cap` PERMANENTLY: `reversed_at` is stamped (it is still the webhook
 * idempotency guard) but nothing was actually clawed back, so the widened
 * partial index keeps treating the row as live. That is the right default —
 * the customer provably still holds the £/$ credit, and freeing the cap would
 * let the same group mint a SECOND one — but phase 1 shipped with no way out.
 * Once staff settle the balance by hand in the Stripe dashboard, the row went
 * on blocking the group forever and the alert email said so in as many words.
 *
 * This is the way out. Two design rules, both load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. **Both outcomes are expressible.** `clawed_back` ("I removed the credit
 *     in Stripe") releases the cap; `kept` ("the customer keeps it") leaves
 *     the cap held and records that a human decided so. A tool offering only
 *     the first is a lever for handing out a second credit; one offering only
 *     the second cannot resolve anything. Neither is the safe default, so
 *     neither is a default — the caller must say which.
 *  2. **Nothing here touches Stripe.** The claw-back this records ALREADY
 *     HAPPENED, by hand, which is the only reason a human is in the loop at
 *     all: the undetermined branch exists precisely because the balance pool
 *     could not be attributed automatically. Creating a balance transaction
 *     from here would debit a customer whose money was already taken back.
 *
 * The write and its `staff_audit_log` row commit TOGETHER (the admin-addons.ts
 * / #272 adminAdjust pattern) — a crash between them could otherwise free a
 * money-bearing cap with nobody's name against it, and the audit row is the
 * ONLY record of who decided and which way (`reversal_undetermined_at` going
 * NULL says the decision happened, not who made it).
 *
 * NO entitlement-cache invalidation is needed here, deliberately and checked:
 * `pass_credit_redemptions` is read in exactly one place outside this file's
 * own reversal lookup — `groupAlreadyRedeemed`, called live inside
 * `creditPassTowardSubscription` on the checkout path. It feeds no
 * `lib/entitlements.resolve()` branch and no `ent:<org>:*` cache key, so there
 * is no TTL window in which a resolved row keeps behaving as unresolved.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

 *   corrected to what was actually taken.
 * - `kept` — the customer keeps the credit (goodwill, un-splittable pool,
 *   whatever finance decided). The cap must GO ON holding, exactly as before;
 *   all that changes is that the row is no longer an unanswered question.
