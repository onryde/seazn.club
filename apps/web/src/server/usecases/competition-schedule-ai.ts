// #350 Multi-division joint AI scheduling — Phase A joint context pack.
//
// buildCompetitionPack unions several divisions of ONE competition into a
// single deterministic pack. It owns no SQL of its own beyond the competition
// lookup: every division's board is assembled by the existing
// buildSchedulePack in schedule-ai.ts, then merged here. That keeps one
// loader, one draft solver and one set of ordering invariants.
//
// Determinism is contractual (see schedule-ai.ts:1-12 — a golden snapshot binds
// two builds of an identically-seeded board to be byte-identical). Every array
// here sorts on stable DOMAIN keys; where a joint sort needs a division
// discriminator it uses the division's NAME and SLUG, never the per-seed UUID.
// Slug matters as more than a tie-break: division order decides the sequential
// draft below, so it decides pack CONTENT, and `createDivision` enforces a
// unique slug but not a unique name.
//
// The three things a joint pack must get right that a per-division pack cannot:
//   * the run's own divisions must not be served to each other as immovable
//     obstacles. buildSchedulePack flattens every sibling division to the
//     anonymous OTHER_DIVISION_LABEL, so they are excluded at the source
//     (`excludeDivisionIds`) rather than filtered out afterwards — a slot-key
//     filter cannot tell "division B's fixture re-served to me" from "excluded
//     division C happens to sit on the same court at the same instant", and
//     deleting the second is deleting a hard constraint with no trace.
//   * courts are matched across divisions by LABEL and nothing else, so the
//     pack names the labels that do not appear in every selected division
//     (`divergentCourts`) for the board to warn on.
//   * the shared-player map is rebuilt over the whole run. A per-division map
//     keeps only persons in >= 2 of ITS OWN entrants, so someone in one entrant
//     of A and one of B is in neither — invisible to a union of the two. H4
//     points the model at that map, so leaving the gap would ask it to avoid a
//     clash it was never shown.
//
// THE DRAFT IS A LEGALITY HINT, NOT A BALANCE HINT. Divisions are drafted in
// sequence, each seeing what the ones before it took, which makes the joint
// draft free of cross-division court clashes but maximally UNBALANCED by
// construction: the first division gets every prime slot and the last gets
// whatever is left (and on a board that does not fit, nothing at all — hence
// `draftPlaced`). That trade is deliberate. Legal-but-unbalanced beats
// balanced-but-clashing for something that is only a starting point, and
// chunked interleaving would put the determinism contract at risk for a hint.
// Fair prime-slot distribution across divisions (the plan's rule J4) is the
// MODEL's job, and JOINT_RULES tells it to rebalance rather than anchor on what
// it was handed.

// #350 Phase B — the JOINT VERIFIER and the JOINT RUNNER.
//
// THE CENTRAL DESIGN DECISION, stated once here because everything below
// follows from it:
//
//   `validateAssignments` takes ONE scalar config — one matchMinutes, one
//   gapMinutes, one blackouts[], one sessionWindows[], one constraints. A joint
//   run's divisions legitimately differ on every one of them.
//
// The tempting move is to merge them into a "strictest" config and make one
// call. That is wrong in both directions and silently: a merged session window
// applies division A's 09:00-12:00 to division B's fixtures (rejecting a legal
// afternoon board), and a merged blackout blacks out a division that never had
// one. There is no merge that is sound, because the fields are not properties of
// the BOARD — they are properties of a division's fixtures.
//
// So `verifyJoint` runs one pass PER DIVISION, with that division's own config,
// over that division's own fixtures, handing every OTHER division's proposed
// slots plus every obstacle in as `existing`. `validateAssignments` reports
// conflicts only for the assignments it is given, never for `existing`, so each
// pass judges exactly one division's fixtures by exactly one division's rules —
// while the checks that read the whole board (court occupancy, person overlap,
// feed order) still see every division's fixtures. That is precisely what
// JOINT_RULES' preamble promises the model, and the model is graded on it.
//
// Two consequences worth naming, both covered by tests:
//   * a cross-division court clash is reported TWICE, once per side, from the
//     two divisions' own passes. That is the desired report — either fixture
//     can be the one that moves — but it is also why some conflicts genuinely
//     arrive twice and are deduped below.
//   * cross-division court gap is charged at each division's OWN gapMinutes, so
//     verifyJoint can legitimately reject the greedy draft it was handed (the
//     drafting division applied its own, smaller, gap). Expected, not a bug.
// ===========================================================================

 *    is the single easiest way to make this whole module wrong — a 30-minute
 *    reading of a 90-minute division's fixtures reports a clean board.
 *  * `divisionId` is stamped, because it is what `verifyJoint` partitions on.
 *    It has one further effect, deliberate: `effectiveRestMinutes` consults
 *    `constraints.restByGroup[divisionId]`, which the single-division path
 *    never reaches (it leaves divisionId unset). Since each division's pass runs
 *    with that division's own constraints, a restByGroup entry keyed by a
 *    division now governs that division's own fixtures — which is what the field
 *    means.
 *
 *    This bullet used to end "`poolId` is deliberately still NOT stamped,
 *    matching the single-division path exactly." That symmetry was real and the
 *    conclusion was wrong: the single-division path was not a baseline, it was
 *    the same bug (#446). `poolId` is stamped now, on both paths, and the pack
 *    has carried it all along as `PackFixture.pool`.
 *  * An unresolvable assignment THROWS rather than defaulting.
 *
 *  That last one is the important one, and it is why there is no `?? 0` here.
 *  An assignment whose fixture is unknown, or whose division is not in the run,
 *  has no duration and no division. Defaulting it produces something far worse
 *  than an error: a zero-length assignment carrying no `divisionId` matches NO
 *  division's `mine` filter in `verifyJoint`, so it is verified by nobody while
 *  still being injected into every other pass's `existing` as a phantom
 *  zero-duration court booking. A wrong answer that looks like a right one.
 *
 *  The runner cannot reach this — `jointStructuralCheck` rejects foreign ids
 *  before verification — but `verifyJoint` is a pure exported function and the
 *  apply path is expected to reuse this shape over client-supplied assignments,
 *  where no such gate exists. */

 *     double-booking and direct feed order, and nothing else. A court clash is a
 *     property of (court label, interval) and needs no per-division setting; a
 *     direct order violation is resolved from `dependencies` and the run-wide
 *     `ruleFixtures` this builds. So a board this config calls court- and
 *     order-clean IS court- and order-clean under every division's own pass.
 *     That is the guarantee the caller relies on, and it does not depend on any
 *     of the merges below being faithful.
 *   * Everything else merges CONSERVATIVELY — tighter than any one division, never
 *     looser. Rest and gaps take the maximum; blackouts take the union; courts
 *     and session windows take the INTERSECTION. A conservative merge can only
 *     cost the solver solutions, and a solver that finds none falls back to the
 *     LLM round that was going to run anyway. A loose merge would do the
 *     opposite: produce a board that is legal under the merge and illegal under
 *     the division that owns the fixture.
 *
 * COURTS ARE THE SHARP EDGE. Court ownership is a STRUCTURAL rule
 * (`jointStructuralCheck`), not a verifier one — no `validateAssignments` pass
 * rejects an Alpha fixture on a court only Beta owns. Hand the solver the union
 * and it will use the extra courts, and the joint verifier will grade the result
 * clean. Hence the intersection: every court the solver may pick is legal for
 * every division in the run.
 *
 * The cost is real and bounded: a competition whose divisions hold different
 * courts (`pack.divergentCourts` is non-empty) gives the solver fewer courts to
 * work with, and one whose divisions share NO court gives it none — that case is
 * declined outright rather than attempted. The proper fix is per-fixture court
 * domains in the engine's repair input, which is an engine change and not this
 * one; until then the conservative answer is the correct one.
