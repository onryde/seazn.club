/**
 * THE ESCAPE HATCH FROM THE V347 CONFIG SNAPSHOT.
 *
 * The snapshot freezes the resolved cfg a fixture was scored under so a later
 * config edit cannot rescore it or make it unreadable. That is the right default
 * and it has an obvious failure mode: an organiser who genuinely set the WRONG
 * config before scoring started is now frozen into it, and the natural fix —
 * edit the division — silently does nothing. Shipping the freeze without a way
 * out would just convert one class of unrecoverable state into another.
 *
 * So staff can re-freeze one fixture from live config. Three constraints, each
 * load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. AUDITED. One `staff_audit_log` row per re-snapshot, carrying the reason
 *     and BOTH configs — nothing else keeps the cfg that is being discarded, so
 *     the audit row has to be enough on its own to reconstruct what the fixture
 *     used to fold against.
 *  2. REOPENED ONLY. Refused on exactly `LOCKED_FIXTURE_STATUSES`, the set the
 *     ledger itself guards appends on. Rewriting the cfg under a finalized
 *     result is precisely the harm the snapshot exists to prevent; staff must
 *     reopen the fixture first, which is a visible act with its own trail.
 *     The check is re-read inside the transaction under the fixture advisory
 *     lock, because a guard read before the lock is not a guard.
 *  3. SUPERADMIN, enforced at the route (`requireSuperadmin`) — the discarded
 *     config survives only in the audit row this writes, which is a higher bar
 *     than reading `/admin/fixtures`. Pinned by a route test; plain
 *     `requireStaff` would be a silent downgrade.
 *
 * The write and its audit row commit TOGETHER, so a crash can never leave a
 * re-snapshotted fixture with no record of who did it. `sql.begin` rather than
 * `withTenant`: this is a staff action across orgs, and `staff_audit_log` is not
 * an org-scoped table. Mirrors `logStaffAction`'s columns inline rather than
 * calling it — that helper opens its own connection and would land outside this
 * transaction (same reasoning as `admin-plan.ts`).

    // WHY THE NON-STRICT READ FOLD IS THE RIGHT PREFLIGHT, and not a gap
    // (reviewed W4a follow-up, item B6). `fold.ts` passes no `strictFromSeq`, so
    // this proves the fixture still READS, not that the next append will be
    // accepted — which sounds like it leaves room to re-snapshot a fixture into
    // a cfg where every future write 422s. It does not, structurally:
    //
    //   * `append-event.ts` passes `strictFromSeq: candidate.seq`, naming the
    //     ONE event not yet in the ledger. Every recorded event replays
    //     non-strict, byte-identically to this fold. A `strict &&` refusal can
    //     therefore never fire on a recorded event, which makes this preflight a
    //     COMPLETE proof for the prior stream, not a partial one.
    //   * What a strict refusal can still reject is the NEW event, judged under
    //     the corrected cfg — the entry rule doing exactly its job ("this
    //     division plays without colours"). That is not a lockout.
    //   * A real lockout would need a refusal that fires whatever the candidate
    //     is. All 22 `strict &&` sites across the eleven builtins live inside
    //     handlers for sport-specific types (goal, card, suspension, set
    //     summary, pairing, adjust, revise, declaration). None is reachable from
    //     `core.void`, `core.abandon`, `core.forfeit`, `core.note` or
    //     `core.finalize`, so the whole recovery vocabulary — including the undo
    //     whose absence made the original W4a defect unrecoverable — survives
    //     every cfg.
    //   * The one cfg-derived write refusal that IS type-independent is not a
    //     module seam at all: `append-event.ts`'s DRAW_NOT_ALLOWED gate, which
    //     this preflight does not evaluate. Reaching it needs a cfg under which
    //     the stream still folds to a DRAW while `supportsDraws` is false. Of
    //     the five cfg-dependent implementations, each key that turns
    //     `supportsDraws` false also stops the fold producing a draw: generic's
    //     `allowDraws` makes `applyResult` refuse outright (preflight catches
    //     it); period's `overtime`/`shootout` re-fold into an OT period or the
    //     SHOOTOUT phase with a null outcome; carrom's `tieBoard` returns null
    //     instead of "draw" and plays an extra board; cricket only produces a
    //     draw at `inningsPerSide === 2`, the same condition. football,
    //     setbased, nested and boardgame key off the stage kind, which the hatch
    //     cannot change.
    //
    // WHAT WOULD BREAK IT: widening `strictFromSeq` to cover recorded events; a
    // `strict &&` refusal added to a `core.*` handler; or a `supportsDraws` whose
    // cfg key does not also change the folded outcome. The first two are pinned
    // by `admin-fixture-config.test.ts` ("does not leave the fixture in a state
    // where every future write is refused"); the third is not, and is the one to
    // re-derive if a module's draw policy changes.
