/**
 * Move this subscription's extra-ORGANISATION items onto the price of the
 * group's CURRENT plan (v17 gap #293, Task 4b).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The rider is sold at two rates that depend on the plan
 * ($9/mo on Pro, $19/mo on Pro Plus). `setExtraOrgs` re-prices on a PURCHASE,
 * but the common case is not a purchase: a group that upgrades pro -> pro_plus
 * never calls it, and the row sync below reconciles ROWS only — it never looks
 * at an item's price. So an upgraded Pro Plus group kept paying $9/rider for
 * ever (the "Pro + riders undercuts Pro Plus" arbitrage the two rates exist to
 * close) and a downgraded Pro group kept paying $19 (the overcharge mirror).
 *
 * WHY THE WEBHOOK. It is the single convergence point: it fires for an in-app
 * plan change, a Stripe Dashboard edit and a Customer Portal change alike.
 * Fixing only the in-app path would leave the other two open.
 *
 * COMPARED BY PRICE ID, NOT LOOKUP KEY. After a drift replacement with
 * `transfer_lookup_key: true` the superseded price object reports
 * `lookup_key: null`, so a lookup-key comparison cannot tell "wrong tier" from
 * "right tier, superseded price object". Both want the SAME action — move to
 * the price the catalog resolves today — and an id comparison gives exactly
 * that, while being a clean no-op once converged. It also agrees with what
 * setExtraOrgs's survivor match does with each case, which is the property
 * that keeps the active and passive halves from fighting.
 *
 * IN-PLACE UPDATE, NOT DELETE+CREATE. `subscriptionItems.update(id, { price })`
 * is Stripe's documented way to replace the price of an item
 * (billing/subscriptions/change-price, "Update the subscription item"). It
 * preserves `stripe_item_id`, so every org_addons row keyed on it stays valid,
 * there is no window in which the group has no rider, and no row is orphaned.
 * `quantity` is passed EXPLICITLY because that doc is also explicit that
 * changing a price "automatically reverts the quantity to the default value of
 * 1" — omitting it would silently cut a 5-rider group to 1 and revoke four
 * organisations' worth of capacity it is still entitled to.
 *
 * PRORATION: the default, stated explicitly. An upgrade mid-cycle should pay
 * the higher rider rate from the moment of the change and a downgrade should
 * credit the unused remainder — which is exactly what the plan item itself
 * does on the same event, and what setExtraOrgs already does for a tier swap.
 * `create_prorations` books those adjustments onto the next invoice rather than
 * charging immediately (`always_invoice`), so a webhook can never trigger a
 * surprise off-session payment.
 *
 * CONVERGENCE, NOT A LOOP. This update itself produces another
 * `customer.subscription.updated`; on that event every id already matches and
 * nothing is written. The `no write when already correct` tests pin it.
 *
 * NEVER THROWS. The reachable failures are an unsynced catalog
 * (`resolveOrgAddonPriceId` 503) and a Stripe rejection of the item update
 * (notably a subscription in a currency the rider price does not define — the
 * #191 class of problem). A throw here would fail the whole webhook, which
 * Stripe then retries for ever and which would block every handler after it —
 * including the row sync, which is the thing the entitlement resolver actually
 * reads. So a failure is logged AND STAFF-ALERTED and processing continues:
 * rows still reconcile, only the PRICE stays stale.
 *
 * A FAILURE IS OBSERVABLE, NOT REPAIRED. There is no retry here: this runs only
 * when a `customer.subscription.created`/`.updated` event arrives, so "the next
 * event re-converges it" is worth nothing for a group Stripe has no reason to
 * emit another event about.
 * That group bills the wrong rate indefinitely, which is why every failure path
 * raises a staff alert rather than only a log.
 *
 * `sweepStaleOrgAddonPrices` (#332, below) is the second half of that net: it
 * finds a group that went stale before the alert existed, or whose alert was
 * missed. It REPORTS ONLY — it re-prices nothing — so this alert is still what
 * a responder acts on, and the sweep is still not a repair. Note also that it
 * is not yet SCHEDULED: the cron step and the /admin mismatch list that read it
 * are the remaining halves of #332.

/**
 * Periodic backstop for the extra-organisation rider's two rates (v17 gap
 * #332). REPORTS, never repairs.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. `convergeOrgAddonPrices` is the only thing that moves a rider
 * onto its group's current rate, it runs ONLY on a
 * `customer.subscription.created`/`.updated` delivery, and it deliberately
 * never throws — so each of its reachable failures (an unsynced catalog, a
 * currency outside the rider price's `currency_options` (the #191 class), a
 * duplicate rider losing the target-price claim) ends in a log, a staff alert
 * and a group left on the wrong price. Nothing SCHEDULES another event for that
 * group, so "the next event re-converges it" buys nothing for a customer who
 * never changes plan again. The alert covers the moment of failure; it does not
 * cover a group that went stale before the alert existed, or one whose alert
 * was missed. This is what covers those.
 *
 * The invariant is load-bearing rather than cosmetic, though not for the reason
 * originally written here. That reason was a TIER ARBITRAGE — $9 on pro against
 * $19 on pro_plus, with a rider stuck on the cheaper price letting "Pro +
 * riders" undercut Pro Plus. Entitlements v18 (V393) retired `pro_plus`, so
 * there is one purchasable plan and one rider rate, and no arbitrage is
 * reachable.
 *
 * What remains is the plainer fault and it is still money: a rider left on a
 * price its plan no longer charges bills that rate for as long as nobody looks,
 * over- or under-charging by whatever the two prices differ by. Nothing
 * schedules a retry, so "for as long as nobody looks" is the operative clause.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT RE-PRICE, and that is the deliberate half of #332's third
 * question. A sweep that repaired would be a BULK billing mutation — every
 * fixed item bills a proration, unattended, against subscriptions whose owners
 * are not present — and the fault that made them stale (an unsynced catalog, an
 * unsupported currency) is very likely still present, so the repair would
 * mostly fail and the successes would be the ones nobody vetted. Report first,
 * read the list, then decide. Making it repair later is a change to this
 * function, not to its callers.
 *
 * IT COMPARES PRICE IDS AGAINST LIVE STRIPE STATE, for two reasons. The DB
 * records the rider's `stripe_item_id` and never its price, so there is nothing
 * local to compare; and the whole failure class is "our idea of this
 * subscription and Stripe's disagree", which a read of our own tables cannot
 * see by construction. By ID and not by lookup key — the same comparison
 * `convergeOrgAddonPrices` makes, and for the reason recorded there: a price
 * REPLACED under the same lookup key is a genuinely different price that a
 * key-wise comparison would call converged.
 *
 * COST is one `prices.list` per DISTINCT PLAN in the pass (memoised, not once
 * per rider) plus one `subscriptionItems.retrieve` per live rider — and the
 * working set is only groups that have BOUGHT an extra organisation, which is a
 * small minority of subscriptions. `limit` bounds it hard.
 *
 * `total` IS NOT `checked`, AND THE GAP IS THE POINT. `limit` truncates a
 * STABLE ordering (`a.created_at`), and unlike sweepStuckEvents' working set —
 * which DRAINS, because a replayed row stops being stuck — this one does not: a
 * rider stays live and re-selectable for ever, converged or not. So once the
 * estate exceeds `limit`, the same oldest N are re-examined every pass and the
 * NEWEST riders are never looked at, silently. Returning the unlimited count
 * beside the examined one makes that visible (`checked < total` means this pass
 * did not cover the estate) rather than leaving a backstop that has quietly
 * stopped backing anything up. Both counts are read through ONE predicate
 * builder for the same reason: a duplicated WHERE clause that drifted would make
 * `total` a lie about the very thing it exists to police.
 *
 * NEVER THROWS ON A SINGLE ROW. One unreadable item must not abandon the rest
 * of the sweep, so each Stripe read is caught and classified:
 *  - `vanished`   — the item is gone from Stripe (`resource_missing`). Not a
 *                   price fault and not alerted; the org_addons row outliving
 *                   its item is a different bug with a different owner (#329).
 *  - `unreadable` — any other Stripe failure. Explicitly NOT reported as a
 *                   mismatch: a transient outage that rendered as "this group
 *                   is billing the wrong rate" is exactly the false positive
 *                   that teaches a responder to ignore the list.
 *  - `unresolved` — we could not name the expected price (catalog unsynced, or
 *                   a plan with no rider SKU at all). Reported and alerted,
 *                   because a rider nobody can price is stale by definition.
 *
 * The DB read is deliberately gated on `LIVE_SUBSCRIPTION_STATUSES` and a
 * non-null `stripe_subscription_id`: a canceled group keeps its Stripe id
 * forever, and re-pricing (or paging anyone about) a departed customer's rider
 * is noise. `status = 'active'` on the org_addons row excludes both the
 * `canceled` freeze-not-delete rows and admin `granted` rows, which have no
 * Stripe item and therefore no price to be wrong.
 *
 * REPEATS ITS ALERTS. There is no attempt counter to park a row with (unlike
 * sweepStuckEvents, which has `replay_attempts`), so a group that stays broken
 * is alerted again on the next pass. That is the intended behaviour for a money
 * fault — it should nag until someone acts — and it is bounded by
 * ORG_PRICE_SWEEP_ALERT_CAP per pass. The de-duplicated read is the /admin
 * mismatch list (#332's second half), which renders `mismatches` directly.

 * Reflect a subscription's extra-ORGANISATION items into org_addons (v17 gap

 * (setExtraOrgs) mutates Stripe; THIS is the SINGLE writer of the resulting
 * rows, so Stripe and the DB can never diverge — the same contract as
 * syncSeatAddonsForSubscription, deliberately kept as a SIBLING of it rather
 * than folded into one shared function:
 *
 *  - A seat is PER-ORG. It resolves a `target_org_id` out of item metadata and
 *    refuses the item without one, because a seat lifts exactly one club's
 *    members.max.
 *  - An extra org is GROUP-WIDE. `orgs.max_owned` is a property of the whole
 *    billing group (every member org resolves the same cap), so `target_org_id`
 *    is ALWAYS null and there is no metadata to resolve — which is also what
 *    keeps the two families apart at the filter: `isSeatAddonItem` requires
 *    `metadata.target_org_id`, which an org-addon item never carries.
 *
 * Sharing one function would mean either dropping the seat's target_org_id
 * guard-rail or growing a mode flag through the seat path for no gain; the
 * codebase already prefers siblings here (grantSizePackAddon sits beside the
 * seat sync for the same reason).
 *
 * `feature_key`/`delta_each` are PINNED from the catalog
 * (ORG_ADDON_FEATURE_KEY/ORG_ADDON_DELTA_EACH), never trusted from item
 * metadata: a divergent metadata key would write the row on an arbitrary cap
 * that the orgs.max_owned-scoped reconcile below never cancels — a stuck lift.
 *
 * UPSERT keyed on `stripe_item_id` — V324's partial unique index IS the
 * idempotency (feature-key agnostic, so it serves seats and org add-ons alike),
 * and a redelivered event therefore neither duplicates a row nor double-counts
 * the cap. Any active org-addon row for this GROUP whose item Stripe no longer
 * reports is FLIPPED to status='canceled' (freeze-not-delete, V323/V324) —
 * never deleted, never written with qty=0 (the V324 CHECK forbids it).
