// SPEC-3 §3 — the unified per-org "Adjustments log". Every staff adjustment
// already writes ONE row to staff_audit_log (V103: actor_id, action,
// target_type, target_id, detail jsonb, created_at; indexed on
// (target_id, created_at desc)). So this is a READ + derive over that one
// table, scoped to one org and the org-adjustment action subset — NOT a
// multi-store union. Callers must have passed requireStaff (any staff READS;
// the write-restriction lives in the T1/T2 mutation routes). The rendered UI
// is SPEC-6.

/** The org-adjustment action subset that surfaces in the log. Excludes
 *  view/impersonate and the non-per-org catalog actions (coupon, fee,
 *  size_pack). Exported so the routes and tests share the one source.
 *
 *  This is an ALLOWLIST, so an org-targeted action missing from it is audited
 *  and unreadable — present in the raw staff-history list, absent from the
 *  panel an operator actually reads. The entries below that are SPREAD rather
 *  than typed out are the ones whose action string is built by the writer
 *  (a template, a union arm) and therefore the ones that can grow without
 *  anybody remembering this file: deriving them here means a new verb reaches
 *  the maps below as a missing key, i.e. a compile error, not a silent gap.
 *
 *  DELIBERATE EXCLUSIONS, beyond view/impersonate and the catalog actions. Three
 *  org-targeted actions read as omissions and are not; each was re-checked at
 *  its writer and each would be a regression to add:
 *
 *  - `billing_group.detach_wallet_not_carried` (credits.ts,
 *    auditWalletForfeitedOnDetach) and `billing_group.detach_comp_granted`
 *    (billing-groups.ts, auditCompGrantedOnDetach). Both are CUSTOMER
 *    self-service: the customer detaching their own org is the `actor_id`, and
 *    `CUSTOMER_SELF_SERVICE_AUDIT_ACTIONS` in lib/admin.ts records why they are
 *    kept out of a panel that reads as "what staff did" (v17 gap #308 — a busy
 *    day of ordinary detaches otherwise renders as staff activity, drowning the
 *    unusual staff behaviour the panel exists to surface). Listing them here
 *    re-introduces precisely the noise that gap removed.
 *  - `platform_dispute` (billing-events.ts, notifyStaffDispute). Written by a
 *    STRIPE WEBHOOK, not by a person. `staff_audit_log.actor_id` is NOT NULL, so
 *    the row is attributed to whichever superadmin `order by created_at limit 1`
 *    returns — an accountability placeholder, not an actor. Its target IS the
 *    org, so allowlisting it would put it in the panel under the name of an
 *    operator who did nothing. */
