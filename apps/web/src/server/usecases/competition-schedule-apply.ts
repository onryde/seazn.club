// #350 Multi-division joint AI scheduling — Phase C, the ATOMIC APPLY.
//
// THE ONE THING THIS MODULE EXISTS FOR: one transaction writes every selected
// division's board, or none of it (spec §8).
//
// Nothing else in this product spans divisions. `applySchedule`
// (schedule.ts:478) takes ONE division advisory lock, asserts ONE division's
// seq and bumps ONE division's seq, and the board applies a multi-stage plan by
// calling that endpoint in a loop — so a stale token, a frozen division or a
// blocking conflict discovered on the fifth call leaves the first four
// committed and the organiser holding half a schedule with no undo that spans
// the rest. A joint plan is solved as one board; it has to land as one board.
//
// Three consequences of "one transaction" that are easy to get subtly wrong:
//
//   * LOCK ORDER IS A DEADLOCK GUARD. Holding N advisory locks means two
//     concurrent joint applies over overlapping division sets deadlock unless
//     both acquire in the same order. `lockOrder` sorts on the division UUID,
//     and that is the ONE place in #350 where sorting on a UUID is correct: it
//     is an input discipline over lock acquisition, not an output ordering.
//     Every array this module RETURNS still sorts on domain keys.
//
//   * THE SEQ ASSERTION SITS IN THE WRITE LOOP, not in a pre-pass. Moving it
//     earlier would be harmless in production — the locks are already held, so
//     no seq can move underneath us — but it would make the rollback
//     acceptance test pass for the wrong reason: an implementation that checks
//     every precondition before writing anything looks atomic without being
//     atomic. Interleaved, the only thing that can keep the first division's
//     rows unchanged after the second division's token is rejected is the
//     transaction itself.
//
//   * EXACTLY ONE `schedule.applied_multi` ROW PER TRANSACTION.
//     `lastCompetitionAiApply` orders by (created_at desc, id desc);
//     competition_events.id is a random uuid and `now()` is transaction-start
//     time, so two rows written in one transaction tie on created_at and the
//     tie-break becomes a coin flip rather than "latest". One writer, always.
//
// VERIFICATION IS THE JOINT ONE, not N single-division ones. A cross-division
// court clash is invisible to a per-division pass — the other division's
// fixtures are not on its board — so a loop of `applySchedule` calls will
// happily double-book a court and report success. This module runs the
// `verifyJoint` shape (one `validateAssignments` pass per division, with that
// division's OWN config, over the MERGED board) and reuses `verifyConfigFor`
// verbatim so plan time and apply time cannot disagree about what is legal
// (ruling R11).
//
// It is NOT a call to `verifyJoint` itself, and the reason is data, not taste:
// `verifyJoint` reads a `CompetitionPack`, whose obstacles carry no entrants
// and no people, and building one here would mean re-running the greedy draft
// solver inside an advisory-locked transaction (its own `withTenant` would take
// a second connection and block for ever on the locks this one holds). The
// board this module assembles is richer than a pack's — every untouched and
// sibling fixture arrives through `toAssignment` with its people attached,
// exactly as `applySchedule` builds them — so apply-time verification sees
// strictly more than plan-time did.
//
// For a COMPLETE apply — every movable fixture the plan covered is listed — the
// extra that richer board can find is rest and person-overlap. A PARTIAL apply
// is a different case and the claim must not be
// stretched over it: the board's `excludedFixtureIds` path (`ai-apply.ts:201`)
// leaves the excluded fixtures at their OLD slots, where `untouched` turns them
// into court occupancy that was not occupancy at plan time — so a partial apply
// CAN be refused with a `court` conflict against a fixture the plan intended to
// move. That behaviour is right (it really would be a double-booking); it was
// the "can never be refused" phrasing that was too broad.
//
// R13: warnings come back in full. Blackout, session-window, start-window and
// rest violations do not block, fire no repair round, and the prompt tells the
// model it will not be asked to repair them. Nothing here filters, dedupes away
// or collapses them beyond the exact-duplicate collapse `verifyJoint` does.
//
// BLOCKING IS DELTA-BASED (#399). `isBlocking` — now `isBlockingConflict`, one
// definition in the engine shared with the board — says what is physically
// impossible: a court booked twice, a human on two courts at once, a slot
// outside the competition's days, a fixture placed before its feeder is done.
// This module then refuses only what THIS apply introduced or worsened, by
// verifying the pre-apply board with the identical passes and taking the
// difference on conflict identity.
//
// The delta is not a softening; it is what makes the promotion survivable.
// Boards published before #399 may hold person overlaps, because those were
// warnings all along. Under an absolute rule the organiser's next joint apply
// over such a competition would 409 with nothing they could do about it — the
// board is already dirty, and every edit is refused for the dirt. The
// per-division `crossPersonClash: "hard"` branch is gone with it: a person
// double-booking is refused for every division now, so the opt-in no longer
// decides what may be WRITTEN (it still steers the solver).
//
// This module charges NOTHING — the plan run was already priced and paid for at
// `aiPlanForCompetition`. It is still GATED, on `scheduling.multi_division` and
// nothing else. The request carries full client-supplied assignments, so this
// endpoint needs no prior plan run and no AI at all: it is a multi-division bulk
// write in its own right, and `scheduling.multi_division` is the paywall for
// exactly that capability. `scheduling.ai` is deliberately NOT required —
// applying is not an AI action, and the plan endpoint already charged for the AI.
