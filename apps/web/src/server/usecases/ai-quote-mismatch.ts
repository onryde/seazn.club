// #387 — did the organiser get charged what the confirm card promised?
//
// The card computes its quote by calling the same pure function the server
// calls (`quoteRun` in lib/ai-rung.ts). That design is deliberate and good: no
// per-keystroke fetch, one arithmetic implementation. It rests on one premise —
// same function, same inputs, same environment — and PR #359 found three ways
// that premise breaks. #385 closed the largest of them.
//
// DETECTION IS SERVER-SIDE. The client sends the number its card showed; the
// server compares it against what it actually charged. The telemetry then fires
// even when nobody is looking at the screen, and the event is written by the
// side that knows the truth about the charge.
//
// This is TELEMETRY, NOT A GATE. A mismatch never refuses a run and never
// alters a plan: the organiser already paid, and refusing here would take their
// credit and give them nothing. It is recorded and reported.

 * Compare the card's quote to the charge, record the divergence, return it.
 *
 * Called by all three run paths (`schedule-ai.ts`, `competition-schedule-ai.ts`,
 * `officials-ai.ts`) so they cannot come to different conclusions about what
 * counts as a mismatch — a fork between those three is what produced the
 * divergence #387 is about in the first place.
 *
 * `undefined` quoted is SILENCE, not zero: server-side callers, smoke and every
 * external consumer send nothing, and reading that as "quoted 0" would file a
 * mismatch against every one of them.
 *
 * Best-effort BY CONSTRUCTION AND BY CATCH, and it needs both. It is called
 * AFTER the run's own ledger row, so the credit is already spent and the plan
 * already generated — but the three call sites await it bare, inside functions
 * whose outer wrapper re-throws once `claim.creditConsumed` is true. An
 * uncaught insert failure there would turn a paid, successful run into a 500,
 * which is the exact outcome this telemetry exists to avoid causing. So the
 * write is caught here, once, rather than at each call site where a fourth
 * path would forget it.
 *
 * The catch does NOT suppress the return value. The comparison is pure and
 * already known to be true by this point; a lost telemetry row is no reason to
 * tell the caller their quote matched when it did not.
