 * SPEC-2 §3/§7). +1 orgs.max_owned per unit, GROUP-WIDE (not scoped to one org,
 * unlike a seat, which lifts one org's members.max).
 *
 * Priced per plan by lookup_key, but the catalog holds ONE entry today: `pro`
 * (config/stripe-plans.json `org_addons`). Entitlements v18 (V393) retired
 * `pro_plus`, so the "two rates are load-bearing, one flat rate would let Pro +
 * extras undercut Pro Plus" argument this comment used to make no longer has a
 * second tier to make it about. The rate itself lives in that config file and
 * is not restated here.
 *
 * Rides the group's EXISTING Stripe subscription as an extra subscription ITEM
 * (one invoice, one billing cycle, Stripe-native proration) — never a second
 * subscription. This mutates STRIPE ONLY: the org_addons row is written by the
 * customer.subscription.updated webhook (syncOrgAddonsForSubscription,
 * billing-events.ts), the single writer, so Stripe and the DB can never
 * diverge. Do NOT write org_addons here.
 *
 * Group-payer gated (`requireBillingOwner`, the same gate extra-seat and the
 * credit-pack checkout use) — a non-payer is refused 403 BEFORE any Stripe call
 * fires.
 *
 * FAILURE MODES ARE DISTINGUISHED BY STATUS, not by prose: this module's
 * messages are hardcoded English and must never be rendered verbatim into the
 * four-locale UI. The client maps status -> DictionaryKey (the
 * `passCheckoutErrorKey` pattern):
 *   400 — SESSION / ORG-SELECTION state, and nothing else. `requireBillingOwner`
 *         raises it for "No active organization" and "No billing account for
 *         the selected organization" (billing-manage.ts:130,136), both
 *         reachable from a stale or foreign org cookie. Remedy is "pick an
 *         organisation again". The count refusal deliberately does NOT share
 *         this status — telling someone to fix a number when they need to
 *         reselect an org is the mis-copy this split exists to prevent.
 *   401 — not signed in (AuthError, from requireBillingOwner).
 *   403 — signed in, but not this billing group's payer.
 *   409 — the GROUP cannot hold the add-on at all: no live paid subscription,
 *         or a plan with no extra-org SKU. Remedy is "move to Pro" — the only
 *         plan with a rider today. (Enterprise also lands here and must not be
 *         sent to Pro: its orgs.max_owned is unlimited, so it needs no rider.
 *         The Add-ons tab renders the unlimited notice rather than the stepper
 *         for that group — `orgCap === null && !addonAvailable`, add-ons/
 *         page.tsx — so an enterprise group can only reach this status by
 *         calling the route directly.)
 *   422 — `count` is not an integer in 0..MAX_EXTRA_ORGS, OR the request body
 *         was unparseable (bad JSON, wrong type, unknown field). Remedy is
 *         "choose a different number"; unreachable from a correct control. The
 *         route converts EVERY body-parse failure to this, so a 400 from this
 *         endpoint ALWAYS means org state and junk input never pages anyone.
 *   423 — the reduction would take the group below the organisations it is
 *         ACTUALLY USING. Remedy is "move an organisation out of the group
 *         first" — a different ACTION from 409's "change plan" and from 422's
 *         "pick another number", which is why it is neither. See
 *         `extraOrgsInUse`.
 *   503 — the Stripe catalog has not been synced for this account
 *         (resolveOrgAddonPriceId). Remedy is "try later / contact support".
 *   500 — anything unexpected, notably a Stripe API failure, which escapes
 *         `handler` carrying raw English. T6 needs a generic key for this;
 *         never render the body's `error`.

 * where the whole rule and its rationale now live: the base is the live
 * `org_entitlement_overrides` row else the plan row, read DIRECTLY rather than
 * through `resolve()`/`groupOrgLimit`, because the resolver's read-time
 * degradations (dunning, a never-paid first invoice, an expired trial, a
 * suspended org) would invent riders the customer never bought; admin comps are
 * subtracted; and the result is clamped to what is actually billed.
 *
 * Counts organisations in the **billing group**, not organisations a user owns,
 * because the only exit is `detachOrgFromGroup` — there is no org deletion
 * anywhere in the product (no `deleteOrg`; `/api/orgs/[id]` has PATCH only).
 * Counting the wrong set would leave a customer paying for ever with no way
 * out, which is a far worse failure than the leak this closes.
 *
 * @param purchasedExtraOrgs the riders the group is ACTUALLY billed for — from
 *   Stripe in `setExtraOrgs`, because Stripe is the source of truth for what is
 *   charged and the webhook may be lagging. Required, not optional: an optional
 *   clamp is a clamp somebody forgets.
 *
 *   The clamp is therefore only as good as that retrieve — and a retrieve that
 *   UNDER-reports is not the safe direction here, whatever the general instinct
 *   says. It lowers the floor, and a lower floor lets a reduction through. This
 *   guard's entire job is to refuse a reduction, so permissiveness IS the
 *   failure it defends against: the silent reseller keeps org #11 and stops
 *   paying the rider. (Over-reporting is the recoverable direction — it refuses
 *   a cancellation the customer is entitled to, loudly, with support as the
 *   exit.) What contains it is that `setExtraOrgs` reads the live subscription
 *   ONCE and derives both `previousExtraOrgs` and this argument from that same
 *   read, so the floor cannot disagree with the number being reduced from; a
 *   retrieve that is wrong is wrong about the whole operation, not just about
 *   the clamp.
 *
 * Kept here (rather than moved wholesale) so `setExtraOrgs` reads as one story.
 * The Add-ons tab does NOT call it: `getAddOnsTab` already holds the basis for
 * the capacity it renders, so it calls `ridersInUse` on that same basis instead
 * of paying for the read twice.
