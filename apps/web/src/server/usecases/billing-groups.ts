 * Put Stripe's subscription item on the group's ACTIVE ORG COUNT, and record

 * The rule this replaces — "decrements make no Stripe call, renewal trues them

 * the difference between a customer being billed correctly and being billed for
 * ever for orgs they no longer have. **Stripe cuts a renewal invoice from the
 * subscription item's own quantity.** Nothing at Stripe reads our database at
 * cycle time, so a quantity we never lower is a quantity that never comes down:
 * a federation that goes from eight clubs to three keeps paying for eight for
 * ever. The deferred decrement had to become a real, immediate write.
 *
 * What survives intact is the customer-facing promise, because the two
 * directions are prorated differently:
 *
 *  - UP past what has already been paid for: `create_prorations`, so the extra
 *    seat is PRORATED and `quantity_paid` rises to match.
 *
 *    NOT "charged immediately", which is what this line said until v17 gap #299
 *    and which is contradicted by `billing-events.ts:738-740` in this same
 *    repo: `create_prorations` books the adjustment onto the NEXT INVOICE.
 *    Nothing in this file charges a card — the only Stripe mutations here are
 *    `subscriptions.update/cancel`, a read-only `invoices.createPreview`,
 *    `setupIntents.create` and `customers.update`. The idiom that WOULD charge
 *    on the spot is `proration_behavior: "always_invoice"` (see
 *    `lib/billing-manage.ts:81`, the plan-change path), and it is deliberately
 *    not used here.
 *
 *    The comment mattered: four customer-facing surfaces said "charged now" on
 *    the strength of it, including the confirmation dialog a payer reads
 *    immediately before agreeing. `charged` below is a PRORATION FLAG
 *    (`charged = raising`), not a statement that money moved.
 *  - DOWN, or back UP into a slot already paid for: `proration_behavior: "none"`.
 *    No credit on the way down (no refunds, nothing to farm by cycling orgs) and
 *    no charge on the way back up — but the item moves either way, so the NEXT
 *    invoice is the honest one. That is what makes "a removed org frees a paid
 *    slot you can reuse at no charge until the period ends" true in both halves.
 *
 * SERIALISED on the group row. Retrieve-then-update is a read-modify-write
 * against state only Stripe holds, so two of them interleaving (a detach's
 * post-commit sync against a concurrent attach's) would leave the item on one
 * caller's stale count for ever. The `for update` is therefore held ACROSS the
 * Stripe round trip — unusual, and the deliberate trade: a few hundred
 * milliseconds of contention on one group's row against a permanently wrong
 * invoice. `handOverGroup` does the same thing for the same reason (setting the
 * incoming card as default must be inside the ownership lock); those two are the
 * only places in this file that hold a lock across a network call, and both bound
 * it with a local statement_timeout and a hard client timeout (lib/stripe.ts).
 *
 * `quantity_paid` is the local mirror of what the customer has been billed for.
 * It only RISES here, and — this is the part the reconcile sweep depends on — it
 * is only written when Stripe has actually confirmed the item. A failed update
 * therefore leaves `quantity_paid` disagreeing with the org count, which is
 * precisely the sweep's predicate. It is also raised to whatever Stripe is
 * ALREADY holding, even when this call changes nothing: if the item says 2, the
 * customer is being billed for 2, and forgetting that would let a later re-add
 * charge for the same seat twice.
 *
 * `renewal: true` is the one caller allowed to LOWER it: the cycle invoice has
 * just been cut from the item, so the slots bought last period are spent and
 * what Stripe now holds is, by definition, what has been paid for.

 * checkout. Nothing then retires the row. `reconcileGroupQuantities` skips it
 * (it selects the same three statuses), and `dropEmptyGroup` will not take it
 * because it ever reached Stripe. So the row sits at `incomplete` for ever,
 * describing a subscription Stripe destroyed within 23 hours.
 *
 * THREE things this deliberately does not do:
 *
 *  1. **It does not delete.** The row carries `trial_used_at`, the Stripe
 *     customer link and any dispute history, and the partial unique index on
 *     `stripe_customer_id` depends on it existing. Deleting it would hand the
 *     payer a fresh trial for the price of abandoning a checkout — the farm
 *     #241 closed on the detach path. The row is retired IN PLACE.
 *  2. **It does not guess.** The obvious predicate — "org-less and
 *     `incomplete`, therefore dead" — infers Stripe's state from ours. This
 *     asks Stripe and writes back what it says, through
 *     `syncSubscriptionForGroup`, the one writer that owns that translation.
 *     There is no second copy of STATUS_MAP here, and none of the
 *     `incomplete_expired` predicate that matches nothing (see lib/billing.ts).
 *  3. **It does not cancel at Stripe.** Everything selected here is either
 *     already dead there, or alive and billing for nobody — and the second case
 *     is an alarm for a human, not an unattended cancel of a live subscription.
 *
 * The one-day floor keeps this away from a detach still in flight and puts the
 * whole 23-hour `incomplete` window behind us, so the answer Stripe gives is
 * the final one rather than a checkout somebody is still paying.

/**
 * Cancel a group ONLY if it is still empty.
 *
 * Two shapes have already failed here, and the reason is worth stating exactly,
 * because both looked airtight:
 *
 *  1. Re-count under a lock, commit, then cancel. An attach queued on that lock
 *     proceeds the instant the re-count commits, sees `status = 'active'`,
 *     passes every gate and may be charged for a seat — and only then does the
 *     cancel fire. The org ends up inside a cancelled group having just paid.
 *  2. ONE statement: `update ... where not exists (live orgs)` over a `for
 *     update` CTE. This does NOT close the race, whatever it looks like. In
 *     READ COMMITTED a statement's snapshot is taken when the STATEMENT starts.
 *     The CTE's `for update` blocks on the lock the attach holds, but
 *     `not exists (select 1 from organizations ...)` is still evaluated against
 *     the snapshot taken before the attach committed. EPQ re-evaluation does not
 *     help: it substitutes the updated tuple of the row being LOCKED and
 *     refreshes visibility for no other table — and an attach never UPDATEs the
 *     subscriptions row at all (it takes the lock and writes `organizations`),
 *     so there is no updated tuple to trigger it. Verified against real
 *     Postgres: the group is cancelled with a live org in it.
 *
 * So the lock and the count are separate STATEMENTS inside one transaction. A
 * new statement takes a new snapshot, so the count sees whatever committed while
 * statement 1 was waiting — which is the whole point. Once the row does say
 * `canceled`, attach refuses it outright (its gate reads status under its own
 * lock), so anyone racing is refused rather than admitted to a dying group.
 *
 * The claim COMMITS before Stripe is called, and is rolled back to the captured
 * previous values if Stripe refuses — leaving the group live, billable and
 * visible to the reconcile sweep rather than locally "cancelled" while still
 * charging. The Stripe call is deliberately outside the transaction: it would
 * otherwise hold this row lock across a network round trip, and this runs from
 * `syncGroupQuantity` immediately after that function has released its own.
 *
 * `not_empty` is a normal outcome, not an error: an org arrived, and the group
 * is billable after all.
 *
 * `not_cancellable` is the fourth outcome, and it exists because for a long time
 * there were only three (#367). The claim can match nothing for TWO reasons —
 * an org arrived, or the status is outside the set this will cancel — and
 * reporting both as `not_empty` meant a group that was refused looked exactly
 * like a group that had been cancelled: same shape, no log, no error. A guard
 * that declines silently is indistinguishable from one that is broken, and it
 * cost a wave to notice that this was the former. So the two are now told apart
 * and the refusal is logged with the status that caused it.
 *
 * The status is deliberately NOT widened to match LIVE_SUBSCRIPTION_STATUSES.
 * The one status that reaches this in practice is `incomplete`, which Stripe
 * expires and voids by itself inside 23 hours; cancelling would send Stripe a
 * cancel for a subscription it is about to destroy anyway. See the note on
 * reconcileGroupQuantities, which omits the same status for a different reason.

 * lives HERE rather than beside it in lib/credits.ts because no credits are
 * involved: this is plan entitlement, and credits.ts owns the ledger.
 *
 * `staff_audit_log` (V103), not `billing_events`: billing_events is the Stripe
 * INGEST table, keyed by the Stripe event id it dedupes on (`id text primary
 * key`, webhook body in `payload`), so a synthetic row there would invent an
 * event Stripe never sent and squat on that dedupe key. staff_audit_log is the
 * schema's only generic actor+target+detail sink and its `actor_id` carries no
 * `is_staff` constraint — the argument #285 already made. Unlike sponsors.ts's
 * actorless org-wide packages, a detach ALWAYS has a real user behind it
 * (`actorUserId` is required and authorised above), so the NOT NULL `actor_id`
 * is satisfied honestly rather than by proxy.
 *
 * `inherited_from` is not decoration. The `coalesce(current_period_end,
 * comped_until)` below erases which date won, and the two are very different
 * money: a period a customer actually paid for, versus a comp staff granted by
 * hand. Only this field can tell a reader which one was passed on.

 * funding them in order to leave, and no payer is trapped funding an org that
 * refuses to pay.
 *
 * DETACH REQUIRES NO PAYMENT TODAY. On a `ride_out` (the default) the new group
 * inherits:
 *  - `plan_key`      — it keeps the plan it was already using, but ONLY when
 *    there is a date on which that plan expires (below);
 *  - `comped_until = coalesce(current_period_end, comped_until)` — which the
 *    resolver already degrades to community at read time, so this needs no
 *    scheduler, no new column and no new resolver branch: the org rides out the
 *    period the old payer has already paid for and then drops to Community.
 *    The coalesce is load-bearing. A STAFF-COMPED group has `comped_until` set
 *    and `current_period_end` NULL (admin-plan.ts never sets a period end), so
 *    reading only the period end minted `plan_key='pro'` with no expiry — a
 *    permanent free Pro group that the resolver's expiry arm can never fire on,
 *    self-service, for anyone in a comped group.
 *  - `trial_used_at` — inheriting the stamp is what stops detach farming a
 *    fresh 14-day trial by cycling in and out of a group.
 *
 * NEVER MINT AN UNEXPIRING PAID PLAN. On a `release`, or when neither date
 * exists, or when the old group was not actually paying (past_due, cancelled —
 * an org cannot inherit a paid-through period from a payer who has not paid, and
 * doing so would let a dunning org escape its own degradation by leaving), the
 * new group is plain Community and the org subscribes for itself.
 *
 * The old group's Stripe quantity DOES come down, with `proration_behavior:
 * "none"` — no credit now, but the next invoice is honest. Whether the freed
 * seat stays reusable (release) or is spent with the departing org (ride_out) is
 * decided by `spendFreedSeat`. See syncGroupQuantity.
