/** A DB fixture row as the engine's `Assignment`.
 *
 *  `poolId`/`divisionId` are stamped (#446). They are not decoration: the
 *  verifier resolves a pool- or division-targeted `restByGroup` and
 *  `startWindows` entry off exactly these two fields
 *  (`effectiveRestMinutes`/`startWindowFor`), and the placer resolves the same
 *  rules off the twin fields on `SchedulableFixture` (built at :523 from the
 *  same row). Dropping them here is what made a pool rule bind for
 *  Auto-schedule and evaporate the moment an organiser dragged a card.
 *
 *  Optionality follows the `SchedulableFixture` builder exactly: `division_id`
 *  is NOT NULL so it is always stamped; `pool_id` is nullable and the key is
 *  omitted rather than set to `undefined`, because `Assignment.poolId` is an
 *  optional string and the verifier tests it with `!== undefined`.
 *
 *  `movable` (C1, 2026-08-12 round-order design) is `!f.schedule_locked` —
 *  the established "pinned" predicate this codebase already uses
 *  (`clearableFixtures`'s own `locked: f.schedule_locked`, the COURT-REMOVAL
 *  GUARD above). Always stamped, unconditionally: `Assignment.movable`
 *  defaults to `true` when absent, so this is a safe no-op for the
 *  round-order pair scan on its own, and it matches `divisionId`'s own
 *  always-present convention (`schedule_locked` is NOT NULL, same as
 *  `division_id`).
 *
 *  `roundNo` is gated on `roundRobinStageIds`, an OPTIONAL 4th parameter —
 *  not read unconditionally off `f.round_no` the way `movable` reads off
 *  `f.schedule_locked`, because `fixtures.round_no` is one shared column
 *  populated for EVERY stage kind (bracket rounds, swiss rounds, stepladder
 *  legs all reuse it for display), and forwarding it for a non-round-robin
 *  stage would compare two independent round sequences as if they were one
 *  — the design doc's own motivating symptom. Omitted (not `undefined`)
 *  when the parameter itself is omitted: existing callers that do not pass
 *  it keep their exact pre-C1 behaviour, and round-order enforcement is
 *  correctly inert wherever it is not threaded through (`competition-
 *  schedule-apply.ts`, `schedule-ai.ts`'s AI-plan path, `person-merge.ts` —
 *  deferred this session; see the task report).
 *
 *  `stageId` (C1 fix-loop, Finding 2) is stamped UNCONDITIONALLY, the same
 *  way `divisionId` is — `fixtures.stage_id` is `NOT NULL`, no gate needed.
 *  It rides along regardless of whether `roundNo` itself is forwarded on
 *  this call: `calendar.ts`'s round-order grouping key only reads it off
 *  rows that already carry a `roundNo`, so a `stageId` on a round-less
 *  Assignment is simply never consulted. `calendar.ts`'s own comment on the
 *  grouping key explains WHY it is needed at all — `poolId` alone cannot
 *  tell two round-robin-kind stages in one division apart when neither has
 *  a pool (two `league` stages, say), which is exactly the shape
 *  `roundRobinStageIds` itself already has to return a SET for. */

 *  sites while dropping every typed rule on the floor.
 *
 *  Two of those fields are load-bearing here and both are traps:
 *
 *    tz            `validateInstructionRules` wraps its ENTIRE typed-rule block
 *                  in `if (tz !== undefined)`, on purpose: every rule in it

 *                  in UTC would report a violation the organiser never expressed.
 *                  So carrying the rules WITHOUT the zone is a fix that binds
 *                  nothing. It is `orgTz`, never `tz` — the org zone governs
 *                  every temporal boundary (#397), and the division's display
 *                  override must not move a rule's calendar day.
 *    ruleFixtures  the feeder→dependent half of `min_rest_minutes` iterates it,
 *                  and every `terminal`/`ext_key` selector resolves through it.
 *                  Without it those rules compile, display as enforced, and bind
 *                  nothing — the same failure shape as #443.
 *
 *  No `restByDivision`: that is the JOINT verifier's field, for the one pass per
 *  division `verifyJoint` runs. These paths verify one division against a fixed
 *  sibling board, which is a different question.

 * `autoSchedule` is a SYNCHRONOUS request an organiser is watching, so the
 * engine's own cap is the wrong one here: measured on a 15-fixture, 2-court
 * board it is spent in full, every time, and hands back a 30-second HTTP
 * response for a board that stopped improving long before.
 *
 * 8 seconds is where a 15-fixture, 2-court board's measurements level off —
 * 2s and 5s differ (court imbalance 90 -> 30 minutes), 5s and 10s do not, and
 * small boards finish and prove themselves optimal in well under a second
 * regardless. THAT BOARD IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE. Re-measured on a 40-80 fixture,
 * 4-5 court board (`packages/engine/scripts/bench-build.ts --sizes=40,60,80
 * --per-entrant=2 --wall=8000` vs `--wall=20000`): 40 plateaus by 8s same as
 * before, but 60 keeps improving (makespan 1760->1600 at 8s, ->1480 at 20s,
 * idle only catches up at 20s) and 80 does not even reach a z3 result at 8s
 * (falls straight to greedy) while 20s gets one improved board. 20 seconds is
 * where THIS range levels off — re-run the sweep before moving it again.
 *
 * Expiring is ORDINARY, not a failure: `budget_expired` rides the wire and the
 * result strip says how many improvement targets the run got through. What is
 * NOT ordinary is reading the flag as "not optimal" — optimality is
 * `tiers_completed === tiers_total`; a term or metric drift exits a tier without
 * ever setting it.
 *
 * Task 13's bench sets the DETERMINISTIC budget (`rlimit`); this is only the
 * outer safety cap, and should be revisited once that lands.
 *
 * CONFIGURABLE AT RUNTIME, via `PLACEMENT_WALL_SECONDS` (seconds, to match the
 * service's own units). This is the caller's ASK. The service applies its own
 * independent CEILING, `PLACEMENT_WALL_SECONDS_MAX`, as a `min()` — so the wall
 * a board actually gets is the smaller of the two, and RAISING EITHER ONE ALONE
 * CHANGES NOTHING. Both, or no board's budget moves.
 *
 * Read per call rather than captured at module load: the value must come from

/**
 * The per-ORG cooldown on the auto pass. Ten runs per five minutes.
 *
 * WHY PER-ORG AND NOT GLOBAL. The resource being protected is a SHARED,
 * capacity-constrained one: every solve (BUILD/POLISH directly, REFLOW
 * through `reflowExisting` — none of the three calls z3 for scheduling any
 * more, since C4, 2026-08-14) is a remote call to the placement service,
 * which admits only a small, fixed number of concurrent solves
 * (`PLACEMENT_MAX_WORKERS` on the service side — see `services/placement/
 * fly.toml`; this comment predates that cutover and its "one at a time via
 * `withZ3Lock`" framing is no longer literally accurate, but the underlying
 * shape — a small shared ceiling, not unlimited parallelism — still holds,
 * which is why the numbers below have not been revisited). The failure mode
 * is therefore one org monopolising a queue everybody shares, not aggregate
 * load — and a global limiter would punish precisely the tenants being
 * starved. The key is the org.
 *
 * WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM. Ten runs x `AUTO_SOLVER_WALL_MS` is bounded to
 * ~27% of an instance's solver capacity, whatever the wall is currently set
 * to — `max` stays 10 (the UX reason below is about button-presses, not
 * capacity, and does not move with the wall) and `windowSeconds` is re-derived
 * to hold the ratio: `10 * wallMs / 0.2667`. At `wallMs = 20_000` that is
 * 10 * 20 / 0.2667 = 750s (12.5 min). One org can never take more than ~27% of
 * an instance's solver capacity however hard it is driven — while a human
 * organiser iterating on a board is never blocked, because ten is enough to
 * try all three buttons (Auto / Re-flow / Polish) three times over with a
 * settings change between each. Anyone clicking faster than one run per 75
 * seconds sustained is not reading the results.
 *
 * `max` IS POLICY and is here to be moved. `windowSeconds` no longer is — it is
 * computed from the wall below, because the wall became an env var and a
 * hand-re-derived constant cannot track a value an operator can change without
 * touching this file.
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN, deliberately, and matching every other limiter on this surface
 * (`ai-plan` 5/hr, `ai-plan-competition` 3/hr, `ai-officials` 5/hr). A Redis
 * outage must not delete the feature for every tenant at once, and the queue cap
 * (`MAX_SOLVER_QUEUE`) still bounds what a burst can occupy while it is down.
 * Note this also makes the limiter INERT with no REDIS_URL — local dev, e2e and
 * the test suite — so it is a production control, and any test of it has to mock
 * `incrWindow` to make it real (`schedule-auto-cooldown.test.ts` does).
 *
 * IT MUST NOT SLOW THE FAST REFUSAL. `buildSchedule` answers `solver_busy` with
 * a greedy board WITHOUT taking the z3 lock once two solves are in flight,
 * precisely so the third caller need not wait out two full budgets — a
 * `withZ3Teardown` wrapper destroyed that property earlier in this wave and was
 * deleted for it. This limiter is one Redis INCR ahead of everything, on no
 * lock and no queue, so the refusal path is unchanged; pinned by
 * `schedule-auto-solver-busy-latency.test.ts`, which now runs with the limiter
 * live for exactly that reason.

 *   * the open end is clamped to the WORK — the greedy board proves how much

 *     which drops `buildSchedule` straight back onto the greedy board it was
 *     asked to improve. A 365-day horizon over two courts is ~35k slots — the
 *     solver would be silently inert on exactly the configs it exists for.
 *   * the open START is clamped to `config.startAt`, or to a pinned card if one

 *     window that excluded it would hand back a `window` conflict on a card

 * — see the C4 status-log entry in

 * frozen id correctly (its own `pinnedAssignments`), but every FALLBACK exit
 * — `already_optimal`, a proved tie, `verifier_rejected`, `not_searched` —
 * reports `seed.assignments`, the PLAIN unpinned greedy seed, which has no
 * idea a `current`-only id (no `.locked`) is supposed to stay put. Confirmed
 * empirically against unmodified `build.ts`: a two-fixture repro, both
 * `current`-anchored, mocked onto the `already_optimal` fallback, swapped
 * both fixtures' courts. That fallback is not a corner — it is the ORDINARY
 * shape of a reflow over a mostly-already-placed board (nothing to improve,

/**
 * The full-board report, inside a transaction the CALLER owns (#230 item 2).
 *
 * Extracted from `validateSchedule` so the publish gate can run the identical
 * pass inside its own transaction, after its advisory lock, rather than growing
 * a second validation implementation. The placer/verifier fork is the recurring
 * defect in this subsystem — it has been re-derived three times — and "publish
 * sees exactly what the panel sees" is only a fact while there is ONE body here.
 *
 * `competitionId` is a parameter rather than a re-read: both callers have
 * already selected the division row, and re-selecting it inside would make the
 * gate's view of the world one statement newer than the lock's.
 *
 * THE OFFICIALS SQL BUCKETS ON `settings.orgTz`, NOT `settings.displayTz`.
 * "Which calendar day is this fixture on" is day math, and day math runs on the
 * governing clock (#397; and `ScheduleSettingsOut` says of `displayTz` in as
 * many words: "DISPLAY ONLY. Never use it to decide which calendar day something
 * is on"). The two diverge exactly when a division carries the V305 venue
 * override — `displayTz` is division → org → UTC, `orgTz` is org → UTC — and a
 * blackout is an ORG-level record, one row per official per date, shared by
 * every division they work; bucketing it per-division made one date mean two
 * different days inside one competition. Concretely: org Europe/London,
 * division America/New_York, fixture 02:00Z on 10 Aug. The display lane files
 * it under the 9th, so a blackout on the 10th raises nothing and one on the 9th
 * raises a phantom. Pre-existing, but #230 item 2 promoted this warning from an
 * advisory badge to a PUBLISH-GATE input, so both directions now cost the
 * organiser something: a missed acknowledge step, or a spurious one.
 * Pinned by `schedule-officials-day-zone.test.ts`, on a fixture where the two
 * zones disagree — one where they agree passes under either spelling.
