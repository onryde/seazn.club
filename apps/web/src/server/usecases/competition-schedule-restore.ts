/**
 * POST /competitions/{id}/schedule/restore — undo one joint apply (#386).
 *
 * `applyCompetitionSchedule` writes every selected division in ONE transaction.
 * Undoing it used to be N independent restores driven by a client loop, so the
 * board could never be left half-written by an apply but could be left
 * half-restored by an undo — and a closed browser tab was enough to do it.
 *
 * NOT one transaction, deliberately. `restoreCheckpoint` rewinds by appending
 * inverse events, each its own single-writer transaction (`history.ts`), and
 * that is what makes it concurrency-safe; wrapping N divisions x up to 500
 * appends in one transaction would hold N advisory locks for the whole rewind.
 * What this endpoint adds instead: the loop runs on the server so it cannot be
 * abandoned mid-way by a client, a failure is REPORTED per division rather than
 * left for the caller to discover, and the division set is validated against
 * the apply event rather than trusted — the caller supplies the checkpoint
 * anchors (only the client holds them; the event carries `division_ids` and
 * nothing else), and the set must match the event's list exactly. A subset is a
 * 422, not a partial restore.
 *
 * ── THE ANCHOR, AND WHY IT IS NOT A LOCK ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The concurrent write worth detecting is a JOINT APPLY landing on the same
 * competition while this rewind is running: after it, the anchors in this
 * request describe a board the organiser has already replaced, and rewinding to
 * them would undo the NEW schedule rather than the old one.
 *
 * So the newest joint-apply event is read ONCE, its row id kept as the anchor,
 * and re-read before each division. A different id means a new apply committed
 * in the gap: the loop STOPS, every division it has not reached is reported in
 * `failed` with the reason above, and `ok` is false. Divisions already rewound
 * keep their real `steps` and `watermark` in `restored` — that partial report is
 * the contract. Throwing would discard a truthful record of writes that really
 * happened and leave the organiser guessing which divisions still carry the AI
 * board.
 *
 * DETECTION, NOT EXCLUSION, and the difference matters less than it reads.
 * This endpoint used to hold a competition-scoped session advisory lock across
 * the whole rewind, which the apply also took. It was wrong in four of six
 * review rounds, each time FAIL-OPEN — it claimed exclusion while providing
 * none: taken inside a transaction that committed immediately (a barrier, not a
 * lock); then self-deadlocking against the rewind's own `division:` locks;
 * then silently handed back when postgres.js closed the idle lock connection at
 * `idle_timeout`; then "proved" by a keepalive that showed the CONNECTION was
 * alive rather than that the same backend still held the key, because
 * postgres.js reconnects transparently. A guard whose failure mode is invisible
 * is worse than no guard, because the code above it is written as though it
 * cannot happen.
 *
 * And the protection it really delivered was already per-division: a lock lost
 * inside one `restoreCheckpoint` — up to 500 appends — was not noticed until
 * the next iteration of this loop. The anchor recheck is read at exactly that
 * same granularity, so this is the same protection with none of the liveness
 * assumptions that failed four times.
 *
 * DOUBLE-SUBMIT is handled where it happens, in the client: the console's undo
 * holds an in-flight ref and disables the button for the duration
 * (`ai-competition-console.tsx`). A second browser tab or a reload-retry is real
 * but rare, and it is benign here — a second undo of the same apply rewinds to
 * the same anchors, which is idempotent (`restoreCheckpoint` reports 0 steps
 * when the division is already there).
