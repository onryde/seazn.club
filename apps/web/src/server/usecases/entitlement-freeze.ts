 *
 * The status half stops a quota metering HISTORY — completed and archived
 * competitions are not live surfaces and must not hold a slot. The pass half
 * is v3/07 §3: a pass buys its competition out of the quota, for as long as
 * the pass APPLIES. "A pass row exists" is NOT the rule and getting that wrong
 * cost a release (#347): SPEC-4 §7 ends a pass at the grace boundary, and a
 * live competition past that boundary was keeping a free slot for ever.
 * V343's `pass_applies` is the same predicate the entitlement resolver uses.
 *
 * Callers must alias the competitions table as `c` — the fragment names
 * `c.id`, `c.status` and `c.ends_on`.
 *
 * Four call sites share it, and the fourth is why it was extracted:
 * `assertActiveQuota` already claimed in its own header that this was "the
 * same predicate the resolver uses, so the three sites cannot drift apart
 * again", and `assertPublicQuota` was conspicuously not one of those three —
 * it had NEITHER half. Copying the clauses into it would have made a fourth
 * place to drift; this makes it impossible.
