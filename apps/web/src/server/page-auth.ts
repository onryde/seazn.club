// The /orgs/new destination contract (W2 task 6 — F7's residual).
//
// The org-less bounce used to be a bare `redirect("/orgs/new")` that threw the
// destination away. W1.5 made that reachable rather than theoretical:
// `postAuthLanding` now honours a safe `next` WITHOUT provisioning an org
// (lib/auth.ts:444-453), so a first-time signup arriving at
// `/login?next=/settings?tab=account&email_change=success` lands org-less, is
// bounced here, and the outcome of the email change they just confirmed is
// gone — they see an ordinary onboarding page and never learn what happened.
//
// Both ends REUSE `safeNextPath`. It is not widened, not relaxed, and not
// re-implemented: it is the single origin check in this repo, and W1.5 wrote
// it the way it is because a prefix test on a leading "/" is NOT origin
// validation — `new URL("/\\evil.com", "https://seazn.club").href` is
// "https://evil.com/", the URL parser having normalised the backslash to a
// slash in the authority position. Widening reach to an untouched validator
// is itself a security change, so the reach is exactly two call sites and
// both refuse identically.
//
// Both are exported (rather than inlined where they are used) because neither
// branch is reachable from a node-env unit test: `requirePageAuth` needs a
// session, a database and Next's `redirect()`, and `/orgs/new` is a Server
// Component. `safe-next-path.test.ts` pins the refusals here.

 *
 * `requireOrgPage`'s rule is membership, and that is right for every organiser
 * surface: those pages are about the club. Billing is not about the club, it is
 * about the GROUP — `subscriptions` is its own row with its own
 * `owner_user_id`, one bill may fund many clubs, and `transferGroup` moves that
 * column ALONE, leaving memberships untouched. So a payer can end up funding a
 * bill they are not a member of (by transfer, or by an org owner removing them)
 * and, gated on membership, has no route to any of the pages that manage it —
 * not even to cancel.
 *
 * THE ONE RELAXATION, stated exactly: membership is no longer the only way in.
 * The group's payer is admitted as well. Nothing else moves —
 *
 *   - a member is admitted on exactly the terms `requireOrgPage` gives them,
 *     with the same role and the same `canEdit`;
 *   - a non-member who does NOT pay for this org's group still 404s, so
 *     existence is never leaked to a stranger;
 *   - a scorer who does not pay still bounces to "My matches" (doc 13 §4);
 *   - the payer is admitted READ-ONLY as far as the org goes: `role` is null
 *     and `canEdit` is false, so nothing here becomes a way to edit a club.
 *     What they get is the bill, which is theirs already.
 *
 * `requireOrgPage` itself is deliberately UNCHANGED. Putting the exception
 * inside it would relax the membership rule for every organiser page in the
 * tree to serve three tabs; a separate gate keeps the widening where it is
 * legible and where a reviewer can see its whole audience.
 *
 * `viaPayer` tells the page which of the two it is looking at. Chrome that
 * assumes membership — the back link into the org's own Settings index, which
 * IS member-gated — must not be rendered for a payer who would only 404 on it.
