/**
 * POST /api/billing/extra-orgs — add / adjust / remove the recurring
 * extra-organisation add-on (+1 orgs.max_owned each, GROUP-WIDE) for the
 * caller's billing group (v17 gap #293).
 *
 * Sold on `pro` only: config/stripe-plans.json's `org_addons` holds exactly one
 * entry since entitlements v18 (V393) retired `pro_plus`. The rate lives in
 * that file and is deliberately not quoted here — the "$9/mo Pro, $19/mo Pro
 * Plus" this comment used to carry was stale on both counts. Any other plan is
 * refused 409 inside setExtraOrgs.
 *
 * `count` is the TOTAL the group should hold, not a delta; 0 removes the
 * add-on. Group-payer gated inside setExtraOrgs (requireBillingOwner) — a
 * non-payer gets 403 before any Stripe call. The org_addons row is written by
 * the customer.subscription.updated webhook, never here.
 *
 * The client must map STATUS to a localised message — see setExtraOrgs' doc
 * comment for the full table. The `error` string in the body is hardcoded
 * English for logs and must not be rendered into the four-locale UI.
