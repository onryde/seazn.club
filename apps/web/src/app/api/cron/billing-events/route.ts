 *  leaves the ledger row un-processed forever, and /admin/billing-events only
 *  exposes manual replay). Cron-shaped like /api/cron/registrations:
 *  x-cron-secret header (CRON_SECRET env).
 *  Schedule: apps/cron-worker/src/schedule.ts (the Cloudflare cron Worker,
 *  live while ACTIVE is "true" in apps/cron-worker/wrangler.json). The
 *  onryde/seazn.club.workflow leg also fires it until that schedule is
 *  switched off, so both may fire it meanwhile.
 *  Idempotent — handlers are replay-safe by contract; attempts are capped, then
 *  staff are alerted once. */
