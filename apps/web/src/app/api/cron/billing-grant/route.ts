/** POST /api/cron/billing-grant — daily: grant every billing wallet its
 *  `ai.credits.monthly(plan) * quantity_paid` allowance for this period
 *  (SPEC-2 §5.4/§11.2, v17 Task 6) — Community wallets included, flat 10.
 *  A TRIALING paid wallet multiplies by `max(quantity_paid, live_org_count)`
 *  instead (#291; see `grantMonthlyForAllWallets`'s docstring for why).
 *  Each grant first EXPIRES any unspent `grant`-bucket balance left over
 *  from the prior period (D1, use-or-lose) before adding the new period's
 *  allowance; the `pack` bucket (purchased packs, D2) is never touched here
 *  (see `grantMonthly`'s own docstring). Scheduled by
 *  `.github/workflows/billing-grant-stg.yml`, same daily cadence as
 *  billing-quantity.
 *
 *  **Anchor (README §7 item 7; Cadence fix, SPEC-2 §5.4):** every wallet —
 *  paid or Community — resets on the plain calendar month, never on
 *  `subscriptions.current_period_end`. Keying paid wallets off the Stripe
 *  billing-cycle boundary was tried and reverted: an annual-interval
 *  subscription's `current_period_end` only advances once a year, so that
 *  anchor collapsed 12 monthly grants into a single lump — a cadence
 *  regression, not the "regardless of billing cadence" behavior SPEC-2 §5.4
 *  requires (see `grantMonthlyForAllWallets`'s docstring).
 *
 *  Cron-shaped like /api/cron/billing-quantity: x-cron-secret header
 *  (CRON_SECRET env). Also runs the earn_grant daily-volume farm-watch
 *  (v17 gap #296) — same daily poll, no separate schedule. */
