/** POST /api/cron/billing-quantity — daily: for every live billing group whose
 *  paid-for seat count disagrees with its organisation count, put the Stripe
 *  subscription item back on the truth. Drift is silent by nature (an attach or
 *  detach whose sync failed, an org created into a paid group during a Stripe
 *  outage, a renewal whose sync threw), and Stripe cuts every renewal invoice
 *  from that item — so an uncorrected drift over-bills or under-bills for ever.
 *  Groups merely holding a freed slot are visited too and correct nothing; that
 *  is the cost of a filter that a failed sync cannot satisfy. Cron-shaped like
 *  /api/cron/billing-events: x-cron-secret header (CRON_SECRET env).
 *  Schedule: apps/cron-worker/src/schedule.ts (the Cloudflare cron Worker,
 *  live while ACTIVE is "true" in apps/cron-worker/wrangler.json). The
 *  onryde/seazn.club.workflow leg also fires it until that schedule is
 *  switched off, so both may fire it meanwhile.
 *  Idempotent — it writes only where Stripe and the org count actually disagree. */

    // addonPrices rides this schedule rather than the hourly billing-events one
    // (#332). Same subscription ITEMS as reconcileGroupQuantities above, one
    // field over: that call puts the item's QUANTITY back on the truth, this one
    // reports items whose PRICE no longer matches the plan's rider. Daily is
    // also the honest cadence for its cost — it reads one Stripe price per
    // active rider, so hourly would multiply that by 24 to re-derive an answer
    // that changes only when a price does.
    //
    // Report-only, deliberately: a repairing sweep would be an unattended bulk
    // billing mutation, and whatever left a group on a stale price is likely
    // still there to do it again. `mismatched > 0` is the signal to look.
    //
    // orphanGroups is the mirror image of orphanOrgs (#375): an org with no
    // group, versus a GROUP with no orgs. It retires the second in place from
    // Stripe's own answer — the state `cancelGroupIfEmpty` declines to touch,
    // most often an abandoned first checkout stuck at `incomplete`. Daily is
    // the right cadence: Stripe expires such a subscription within 23 hours and
    // the sweep only looks at rows untouched for a day, so an earlier run would
    // read a checkout somebody is still paying. `stillLive > 0` is the signal
    // to look — a subscription alive at Stripe with nobody on the bill.
