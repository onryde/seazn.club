// v17 gap #333 — a billing group's PAYER must be able to open the billing UI
// for the bill they fund, even when they are not a member of any organisation
// on it.
//
// That state is reachable by design, not by accident: `transferGroup` moves
// `subscriptions.owner_user_id` ALONE and leaves memberships untouched, and an
// org owner may remove the payer from the org at any time. Gated on membership
// — which is what every organiser page under `/o/[orgSlug]` is, and rightly —
// the payer keeps paying for a group whose Billing, Credits and Add-ons tabs
// all 404 on them. Not even cancelling is reachable.
//
// The relaxation is ONE sentence wide and these tests bound it on every side:
// a stranger is still refused, a scorer still bounces, and a member is admitted
// on exactly the terms they had before.
//
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL.
