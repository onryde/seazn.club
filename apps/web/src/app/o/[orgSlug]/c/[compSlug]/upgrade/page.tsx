// billing page (webhook optional).
//
// It was built for one visitor — a community owner who had not bought yet — and
// served four others badly. A non-owner got a price they cannot pay. A buyer who
// came back after hitting the pass's OWN ceiling got the same "you're all set"
// green box as one who came to admire the purchase, with no receipt, no next
// step and nothing to click but "back". And an org on a paid plan was shown
// "You're on Pro" and nothing else, on a page whose whole job is to explain what
// their competition can do.
//
// Seven states now, decided once in `upgradePageState()` and rendered here:
//
//   offer (owner)     the ticket, priced, with the buy button
//   offer (non-owner) the same ticket, no button — the price stays visible so
//                     they can take a number to whoever can spend it
//   owned             the stub flips to floodlit "active": bought-on date,
//                     receipt link, and the Pro step the dead end never offered
//   ceiling           a pass is held and something still blocked them; Pro only,
//                     with the credit line and the blocked limit picked out
//   ended             the pass is on the record but has stopped applying — the
//                     competition reached a terminal status, or ran past its
//                     end date plus the grace week (v17 gap #301). The stub
//                     keeps the rung, the date and the receipt (nothing bought
//                     is deleted) but loses the floodlight, and the page stops
//                     claiming the pass is active. It is never re-offered, so
//                     the two doors out are the plan and the next edition.
//   closed            past the same line as `ended`, but NOTHING WAS EVER
//                     BOUGHT (#376). Its own panel rather than the ticket: the
//                     ticket carries a rung name, a purchase date and a receipt
//                     stub, and all three would be invented for a competition
//                     that never held a pass. No price, no buy button and no
//                     pass column in the table either — the checkout answers
//                     this sale with 410 Gone whatever the plan, so every one
//                     of them would advertise a refusal.
//   paid_plan         NO TICKET AND NO PRICE ANYWHERE. Every boolean the pass
//                     lifts is already true on a paid plan, and Pro raises the
//                     caps the pass raises (128 entrants per division against
//                     256, 10 divisions against no ceiling at all), so an offer
//                     here sells a DOWNGRADE — the defect f70b8e52 fixed in the
//                     paywall. The sales object is absent rather than disabled,
//                     which is the only version that cannot regress into a
//                     re-sale.
//                     Not a strict superset since v17 #294, mind: the L rung
//                     takes the entrant cap off entirely, above Pro's 256. The
//                     copy on this state says "features" for that reason, and
//                     whether Pro may buy L at all is #327.
//
// Every figure in the comparison is read from `plan_entitlements` at render
