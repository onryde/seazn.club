// Competition shell (v3/07 §3): resolves the Event Pass state for THIS
// competition once per request and provides it to every client island
// underneath, so gates stop being unable to ask. Every page below already
// declares force-dynamic; this repeats it because the layout itself does an
// uncached DB read.
//
// THREE facts, not one. "Is there a pass row" alone left an org already on a
// paid plan reading false, and the gate then offered it the Event Pass — which
// for a paid org is a DOWNGRADE, not a redundant sale: Pro's matrix is a strict
// superset of the pass's at every key the pass lifts. So the org's resolved plan
// rides along in the same read.
//
// The third is the pass's own RUNG plus the org's CURRENCY (v17 #294). Both
// exist only on the server — the rung is a column, the currency is a
// subscription/cookie/header resolution — and both are needed by client islands
// that were guessing: the paywall priced every reader on earth in hardcoded usd,
// and the "pass active" signals named the product family while two rungs sell at
// $29 and $59.
//
// The fourth is whether the pass STILL APPLIES (v17 gap #301). The read here
// was row existence and nothing more, so a pass the resolver had already
// stopped honouring — its competition completed or archived, or run past
// `ends_on` plus grace — reached every island underneath looking exactly like a
// live one, and they said "Event Pass active" to an org that was back on
// Community caps. Fixing it at the six surfaces would have been six copies of
// the rule; the join lives here, and `passLockReason` judges it.
//
// Deliberately NOT auth-gated. `requireCompetitionPage` 404s scorers and
// non-members, but the /o layout lets both through on purpose so an accepted
// official's fixture deep-link (design v2 §A2) can reach `requireFixturePage`
// further down. A layout that gated here would break that link before the page
// that owns the decision ever ran. Every child page still runs its own gate, so
// this adds no surface — only a boolean about a competition already in the URL.
//
// Anything unresolvable (missing org, missing competition, or a slug that only
// exists in slug_history) yields `false` and renders children untouched: the
// child page owns the 404 / permanent-redirect, and a pass state is never worth
// pre-empting it.

/**
 * Which pass rung does this competition hold, is the org on a paid plan, what
 * currency does it buy in, and is this competition past the line where a pass
 * applies (or may be sold) at all?
 *
 * The slug lookups go through the React-`cache()`d resolvers, which the org
 * layout and the child page already call with the same arguments — so in the
 * common request the extra work is the three reads below, issued CONCURRENTLY:
 * one round trip in wall-clock terms, and none depends on another.
 *
 * `pass_key` rather than `select 1`: same row, same index, one more column, and
 * it is the only place a client island can learn the rung (v17 #294).
 * `isPassKey` guards it rather than a cast — the column is `not null default
 * 'event_pass'` and a row written by a future rung this build predates must
 * degrade to a real label, not to a missing dictionary key.
 *
 * `status`/`ends_on` (v17 gap #301) ride the same lookup rather than adding a
 * query: the layout is already inside the competition, and the two columns are
 * what decides whether a pass may apply — or be sold — here at all. The read is
 * FROM `competitions` and LEFT JOINs the pass (#376): the earlier INNER join
 * through `competition_passes` returned no row whatsoever for a competition
 * that had never been sold one, so the lock could not be judged in the very
 * case it now has to be. The lock belongs to the COMPETITION; the pass row only
 * decides which side of it the org is on.
 *
 * The judgement itself is `passLockReason`'s, never this file's. The same rule
 * is enforced in three places that must agree exactly — the TS resolver, the
 * `org_has_feature` SQL (V338), and now the UI — and the only defence against
 * them drifting is that two of them call the same function and the third is
 * pinned to it by `entitlements-sql-parity.test.ts`. A status list or a date
 * comparison written here would be a fourth copy.
 *
 * `stripe_payment_intent` is NOT consulted: it is nullable by design (V271),
 * and a staff-granted pass with a null intent is fully active.
 *
 * The plan comes from `orgPlanKey`, the entitlement resolver's own derivation,
 * NOT from `subscriptions.plan_key` raw. The difference is customer-visible in
 * both directions: a live staff comp carries the Pro matrix with no Stripe
 * subscription at all (so must not be sold a pass), while a LAPSED comp and a
 * past_due subscription beyond its 14-day grace both still read `plan_key =
 * 'pro'` on the row yet resolve as community (so the pass genuinely lifts them
 * and must still be offered). Sharing the resolver's derivation is the only way
 * "what we sell" and "what we grant" cannot drift.
