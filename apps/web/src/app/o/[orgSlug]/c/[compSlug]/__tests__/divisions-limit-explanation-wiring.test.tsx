// Both surfaces get the SAME answer from the server (#376 part C review).
//
// The sentence "divisions with recorded results count toward your limit even
// after they are archived" is only true of a refusal the archived rows
// actually caused, and that judgement needs a quota limit — something no
// client component can ask for. So `archivedSlotsExplainRefusal` is computed
// server-side and handed down, and these two pages are the only places that
// hand it down: the wizard, where a create is refused, and competition
// settings, where a restore is refused on exactly the same count.
//
// A missing prop is invisible to `tsc` — both components default it to false —
// so a page that forgot to pass it would render a silent, correct-looking
// paywall. This pins the wiring by walking each page's returned element tree
// and reading the prop off the component that consumes it. No markup is
// rendered: the assertion is about what the server handed the client, and
// `renderToStaticMarkup` would only add a client-component tree that has
// nothing to do with it.
