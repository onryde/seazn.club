//
//   * a NON-OWNER got the full priced card with a sentence under it, which is a
//     price nobody will let them pay;
//   * the OWNED state was a dead-end green box — it confirmed the purchase and
//     offered nothing next: no receipt for the money taken, and no way to Pro, on the
//     one page a converting customer is already standing on;
//   * a buyer sent back here by the pass's OWN ceiling got that same "you're
//     all set" box while still blocked, with no explanation and no action;
//   * `isPro` was read from `subscriptions.plan_key` RAW, which gets a lapsed
//     staff comp and a past-grace past_due org backwards in both directions.
//
// Rendered through react-dom/server — vitest runs `environment: "node"` and
// this workspace has no jsdom (same pattern as pass-checkout-parity.test.tsx).
// Everything the page talks to is mocked EXCEPT the dictionary and the pure
// state/comparison modules: the assertions below are about copy and about which
// controls exist, so the real `en` strings have to be in play.

 * -> 11.99, L 59 -> 39 -> 44.99) broke them TWICE in ways worth remembering: the four POSITIVE
 * assertions failed loudly, but the two NEGATIVE ones — "must not price
 * anything once a pass is held" — went silently VACUOUS. `not.toContain("$29")`
 * passes trivially on a page that has never heard of $29, so the guard against
