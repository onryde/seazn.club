// Phase 2 pass-scoping sweep — `realtime` on the two noticeboard slideshows.
//
// Both boards resolved `realtime` ORG-WIDE while the competition was sitting
// right there: the competition board's route param IS the competition id, and
// the division board had already awaited `division.competition_id` for its own
// title. lib/entitlements.ts only consults competition_passes when a
// competition is in scope, so the live-refresh a community org paid an Event
// Pass for never turned on — the board it bought stayed static.
//
// The matrix makes this a real separation:
//   realtime  community=false  event_pass=true
// so each case asserts BOTH directions: the passed competition's board pushes
// live, and a second, unpassed competition in the SAME org does not.
//
// The page's data seams (auth, division/competition reads, slide building,
// sponsors) are stubbed — the resolver and the database are NOT, because the
// pass overlay is the thing under test. The pages return the <Slideshow>
// element directly, so the prop is read off it without rendering.
//
// Real Postgres required; skipped without DATABASE_URL. Seeds are run-unique.
