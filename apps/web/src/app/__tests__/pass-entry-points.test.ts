// Standing guard for the four Event Pass entry points (task 19, spec D3).
//
// Before this change `routes.competitionUpgrade` had EXACTLY ONE inbound link
// in the entire app — `components/upgrade-gate.tsx`, the paywall. The pass was
// therefore only discoverable to someone a limit had already blocked. The four
// surfaces below are the fix.
//
// Two of them (the competition list and the billing page) are server pages that
// cannot be unit-rendered: they need cookies, an authenticated session and a
// tenant-scoped database. So what is asserted here is what is actually at risk
// on those pages — that the link exists at all, and that the decision to OFFER
// the pass is taken with the ONE shared predicate.
//
// ===========================================================================
// If you found this red, an entry point lost its link or grew a second notion
// of "is this org on a paid plan". Do NOT relax the assertion. Every boolean the
// pass lifts is already true on a paid plan, and Pro's caps sit above the M
// rung's — so a surface that gets paid-ness wrong sells a paying customer a
// DOWNGRADE. That defect shipped once already (fixed in f70b8e52) and a new
// surface is exactly where it comes back.
//
// ("Strict superset", which this said until v17 #294, is no longer true in one
// direction: the L rung takes the entrant cap off entirely, above Pro's 256.
// That is why the paid-plan copy claims FEATURES rather than everything, and
// whether a paid org may buy L at all is #327.)

 * the second where the first is meant is how a withdrawn rung gets offered
 * again, and it is not a mistake `tsc` can see: both are `readonly PassKey[]`,
 * so a selling surface that swaps one for the other compiles, renders, and
 * quietly puts a size back on the shelf that the owner took off it.
 *
 * MEASURED, which is why this guard is source-level and not behavioural: with
 * `lowestPassRung` reverted to `PASS_KEYS`, 167 tests across four suites stayed
 * GREEN. The entry rung is the cheapest in every currency today, so reducing
 * over the full ladder and over the sellable one return the same answer — the
 * two implementations agree by luck, and would stop agreeing the day a dormant
 * rung was discounted, which is exactly the day nobody would be looking. There
 * is no observable difference to assert, so the CALL SITE is what gets pinned.
 *
 * Every file listed here IMPORTS the full ladder deliberately, and each reason
 * is a RESOLUTION reason — recognising, pricing or labelling a rung that already
 * exists — never an offer. `lib/currency.ts` itself is not here because it
 * declares the tuple rather than importing it; `SELLABLE_PASS_KEYS` and
 * `HIDDEN_PASS_KEYS` are filters of it, which is the point — one tuple decides,
 * and the ladder's order cannot diverge between them.
