/**
 * Raw staff_audit_log action → friendly label for the adjustments log table.
 *
 * `Record<AdjustmentAction, string>`, not `Record<string, string>`: keyed on
 * `string` a new allowlisted action needed no label and the table rendered its
 * raw slug (`pass_credit_reversal_resolve`) with nothing failing — the omission
 * was only visible to whoever happened to open the panel. Keyed on the action
 * union, the next addition to ADJUSTMENT_ACTIONS is a compile error here.
 *
 * A separate module rather than a const inside `page.tsx` because Next rejects
 * exports other than the page contract from a page module, so a map living
 * there cannot be reached by the test that checks every action has a label.
 *
 * /admin is staff-only and English-only — no dictionary keys are owed.
