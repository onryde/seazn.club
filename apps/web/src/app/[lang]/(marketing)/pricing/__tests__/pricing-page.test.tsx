// buyer sees both rungs priced side by side before choosing a competition, and
// nothing witnessed it: deleting the whole `<ul data-pass-ladder>` block left
// `tsc` at EXIT=0 and every unit suite green, because `pricing-matrix.test.ts`
// only proves the ROW BUILDER can produce five columns and `pricing-cards.test.ts`
// only proves the copy quotes the right numbers. Neither renders the page.
//
// It also pins the ladder's deliberate ASYMMETRY (see below), which is the one
// way the block can legitimately disappear.
//
// Rendered through react-dom/server — vitest runs `environment: "node"` and
// this workspace has no jsdom (same pattern as upgrade-page.test.tsx). The
// dictionary and every pure pricing module are REAL, because the assertions are
// about the figures and copy a buyer actually reads.
