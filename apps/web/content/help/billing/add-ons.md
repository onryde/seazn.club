title: Add-ons — buying more of one thing
description: Three ways to buy extra capacity without changing plan — AI credit packs, competition size packs and extra organisations. Each one is scoped, billed and bought differently.
order: 7
---

An add-on buys **more of one specific thing** without moving you to a different plan. There are three of them, and they do not behave the same way:

| Add-on | What it lifts | Scope | Billing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI credit pack | Credit balance | The shared wallet | One-time |
| Size pack | Entrants per division, +32 each | One competition | One-time |
| Extra organisation | Organisations on the bill, +1 each | The billing group | Monthly |

## AI credit packs

A credit pack tops up the shared wallet that every organisation on the bill spends from. It is a one-time purchase, the credits land as soon as the payment clears, and the credits themselves **never expire** — unlike your monthly grant, which resets on the 1st. Buy one with **Buy credits** on the Credits tab.

See [AI credits](/help/billing/credits) for the pack ladder, the order runs spend in, and how a billing group shares one wallet.

## Size packs — one competition, bought once

A size pack raises **one competition's** entrants-per-division limit by 32, and does so permanently for that competition. Buy two for the same competition and the headroom stacks. Because it is scoped to a competition it never lifts an organisation-wide limit such as members — a size pack and an extra seat are not substitutes for each other.

Any **owner** of the competition's organisation can buy one. It charges the billing group's saved card only when that owner is also the person who pays for the group; anyone else is charged directly, which is the same rule an [Event Pass](/help/billing/event-pass) purchase follows.

Size packs have **no control in Settings yet** either. [Talk to us](mailto:hello@seazn.club) if you need more entrants in a division before then.

## Extra organisations — the whole bill, every month

One subscription already covers several organisations: Pro covers 5 and Pro Plus covers 10. Once every slot is full, an extra organisation buys **one more slot** rather than forcing you up a plan. Each organisation after the first costs no more than half the base rate.

The add-on is charged **every month, whatever your plan's own billing period** — so on a monthly bill it matches that half rate exactly, and on an annual bill it does not. An annual group pays for its extra organisations monthly, which comes to **at least a sixth more over a year** than a slot inside the plan's own limit costs, and rather more than that in some currencies. If you are annual and expect to stay over the limit, compare the add-on against moving up a plan before you buy.

Raise the count and you pay the difference for the rest of the period, **added to your next invoice** rather than charged on the spot. Lower it and it takes effect immediately, with no refund. You cannot go below the number of organisations that are actually standing on an extra organisation: move one out of the group first.

Buy them on **Settings → Add-ons**. Community cannot, because there is no subscription for the add-on to ride.

## Who can buy, and what it is billed in

A **credit pack**, an **extra seat** and an **extra organisation** are all bought by the group's **payer** — the one person who holds the card and the invoice. A **size pack** is the exception: any owner of the competition's organisation can buy one, because it is scoped to a single competition rather than to the bill.

Once your billing group has a subscription, its **currency is fixed**, and every later purchase uses that currency. You are never asked to choose one twice.

## When an add-on stops

Nothing is ever deleted. What differs is whether being over the limit stops you *using* what you have, or only stops you *adding* more — and the two recurring add-ons answer that differently.

**An extra seat stops you adding members, and makes the ones over the limit read-only.** Cancelling a seat removes nobody and touches no data. What it stops outright is *growing*: an invitation or a promotion that would take you past the limit is refused, everywhere, straight away. Members already over the limit are treated as read-only — the same idea as [what downgrading freezes](/help/billing/downgrade) — and owners never are. Nothing puts a badge on them: it is worked out when a write arrives, and it blocks signed-in admins writing through our REST API, not API-key clients. Inside the app that is not a corner of the product — those routes are what almost every editing screen saves through, so expect a frozen admin to be blocked across most of the app, the schedule board, entrants, officials and settings among them. Treat it as a prompt to make room. Buying the seat back clears both immediately.

**An extra organisation does not freeze anything.** The organisation limit is checked only when a *new* organisation is added, and is never re-applied to organisations that already exist. So a group that ends up over its limit — after a plan change, say — keeps every organisation it already has, fully working; what it loses is the ability to add another until it is back under the limit. That is also why you cannot cancel your way over the line: the control refuses to go below the number of organisations that are standing on an extra organisation, and asks you to move one out of the group first.

Credit packs and size packs are one-time purchases, so there is nothing to cancel and nothing to lapse: what they added stays added.
