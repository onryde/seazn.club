// Every other pass test in this repo grants the pass with an INSERT. This file
// is the one place where the pass price actually moves: embedded checkout, 4242,

// asserts — the lifted quota, the ceiling, the receipt, the Pro credit, the

//   U7  REMOVED by RS001 (registration demolition) — its mechanism was the
//       public register POST, which no longer exists; owed back by RS006/RS007
//   U12 billing page names the purchase and links its Stripe invoice
//   U14 upgrade to Pro inside 30 days: same customer, the pass on the balance,
//       card required, pass dormant not consumed
//   U15 Pro downgrades to community — the pass survives on its competition
//   U16 a full refund revokes the pass (and is where `refunds.create` on the

// * The checkout sheet caps at 85vh and Stripe sizes its iframe to its own
//   content, so "Pay" is frequently BELOW the sheet's clip. Playwright cannot
//   scroll a parent it does not own from inside a cross-origin frame — the sheet
//   is scrolled explicitly in `payWithTestCard`. Without it the click silently
//   lands on the overlay and the run hangs on the return URL.
// * Each block seeds its OWN org with its OWN owner (never the shared Pro or
//   community storageState accounts), so the shared org budget, the community
//   org's competition quota and pricing-v3/journey-community are all untouched.
// * No REDIS in e2e → `lib/cache` is inert, so SQL flips resolve fresh without

 * probing M and then buying L would mint a second session, and U1's "exactly
 * one pass, one intent" assertion is what would catch it.

 * the cheapest. Probing M while the UI buys L would turn an unsynced L price —

 * for that rung — from a clean skip into a mid-test failure at the Stripe

/**
 * THE WIRE — v17 #294's named live-probe deliverable.
 *
 * The buyer's rung has to survive three hops: the picker's React state → the
 * POST body the browser sends → the Stripe price the route resolves for that
 * rung. Only the first hop has ever had an automated witness.
 * `pass-upgrade.test.tsx` drives a fake hook dispatcher and asserts the rung
 * reaching `fetchPassCheckoutClientSecret`; before it existed, substituting a
 * literal `"event_pass"` at `pass-upgrade.tsx:298` passed EVERY suite and
 * `tsc`. What no unit test can see is the network — the body a real browser
 * actually sends, and the amount Stripe is actually asked to collect for it.
 *
 * This asserts both, for both rungs, in one run:
 *
 *   • the POST body observed ON THE WIRE carries the rung the buyer picked;
 *   • the session it opens — fetched back FROM STRIPE by id, not from anything
 *     this repo computed — is stamped with that rung, built on the SAME price id
 *     `plans.<rung>.stripe_price_id_onetime` holds, and charges that price's own
 *     amount in the session's currency.
 *
 * Both directions, because a page hardcoded to L would satisfy the L half on
 * its own — the same anti-vacuity trap the unit witness closed with an M
 * counterpart.
 *
 * The amounts are never written down here: they come from the `plans` row and
 * the live Stripe price, so this stays correct in every currency and at any
 * future price point. What the app ADVERTISES for each rung is compared against
 * what Stripe collects in `pass-checkout-l.live.test.ts`; this file's unique job
 * is the network hop, which no unit test can reach.
 *
 * Nothing is paid: the sheet is opened and the session expired immediately. The
 * rung's price must be synced (`npm run stripe:sync`) or the route 503s, which
 * the probe turns into a clean skip rather than a hang at the Stripe iframe.

/**
 * PAST THE LINE, AND NOTHING WAS EVER BOUGHT (#376).
 *
 * Every other test in this file is about a pass that exists. This one is about
 * the state where none ever did and none ever can: a competition that is
 * finished (or whose end date has run out past its grace) has no pass to sell,
 * because `/api/billing/pass-checkout` refuses it outright. Before #376 both
 * offer surfaces still advertised one — the header chip and the upgrade page's
 * checkout — so an organiser could press Buy on a competition the server had
 * already decided was closed.
 *
 * The unit suites pin each surface's markup in isolation. What only a browser
 * can pin is that they agree: the SAME competition, read through the layout's
 * own join and the upgrade page's own query, resolves closed on both. Those two
 * reads are separate SQL statements in separate files, and a divergence between
 * a placer and a verifier of the same rule is this repo's most-repeated bug.
 *
 * Both arms run. They are decided by different columns and they lead to
 * different routes, so covering only `terminal` would leave the recoverable one
 * — the organiser whose end date is merely stale — free to regress.
 *
 * No Stripe money moves here; the file-level `beforeAll` still requires a test
 * key, which is the file's standing contract and not something this block
 * relaxes.
