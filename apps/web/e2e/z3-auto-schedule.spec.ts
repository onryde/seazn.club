// T15 — the three z3 solver actions on the schedule board, driven through the
// UI against the real engine.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHAT ONLY IT CAN SEE. `schedule-board.spec.ts` already
// exercises `/schedule/auto` over HTTP, so the endpoint is covered. What nothing
// else covers is the loop an organiser actually performs: the button posts, the
// proposal comes back, `useBoardActions` APPLIES it, and the result strip
// reports what the solver did. Three things can only fail here —
//
//   1. the z3 WASM not being reachable from a production-shaped server (it has
//      shipped as a silent prod no-op before, and every unit test stayed green);
//   2. a button wired to the wrong solver — all three render identically and
//      differ only in the body they send;
//   3. the strip reporting a run that did not happen, or not reporting one that
//      did. `lastRun` is client state set between the auto POST and the apply
//      POST; nothing server-side has an opinion about it.
//
// SELECTORS ARE IDS, NEVER COPY (#465). `board.autoSchedule` renders
// "Auto-schedule {name}" — it interpolates the division name — and
// `board.polish` renders "Improve times", not "Polish". Text is asserted in
// exactly one place below, deliberately, where the assertion IS about the copy.
//
// Each test seeds its own competition/division/stage, so the file needs no
// serial mode and no shared fixture: the result strip is per-page client state,
// which means every strip assertion has to live in the same test as the click
// that produced it anyway.

 * immediately — with a greedy board, without taking the lock — once two builds
 * are already in flight. That is reachable in this suite exactly as it stands.
 * The project is `fullyParallel` at four workers, the Auto-schedule and
 * Improve-times tests are both on the build path, and under `test:e2e:all` the
 * two mobile projects each fire one more.
 *
 * Adding `solver_busy` to `SOLVED` would be the cheap fix and the wrong one: the
 * file would then pass against a solver that never ran, which is the single
 * thing it exists to catch. The refusal is transient by construction — the cap
 * clears the moment the runs ahead of it finish, and the strip's own copy for
 * this status is "Try again for a better board" — so a bounded re-click is the
 * honest response. What is asserted at the end is unchanged: a real solve.
