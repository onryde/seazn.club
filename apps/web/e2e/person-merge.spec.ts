/**
 * #404 — the organiser's whole duplicate journey, against a real schema:
 * open the queue, confirm a suggested pair, see the survivor on the roster and
 * the duplicate gone, undo from the merge log, see both records back.
 *
 * Everything before this ran against stubbed props or a seeded usecase. This is
 * the only check that the page a signed-in organiser actually loads is wired to
 * the routes that do the work — and the only place the CONSENT resolution is
 * asserted as something a human can read rather than as a column value.
 *
 * Own empty storageState + `loginUi` + a fresh org, deliberately: the shared Pro
 * org accumulates hundreds of persons across a run and the roster page loads
 * only the oldest 200 (`listPersons` is `order by created_at`), so a pair
 * created late in a shared org can be genuinely correct and simply off the page.
 * A fresh org also makes the queue's own count assertable — in a borrowed org
 * "a candidate is listed" cannot distinguish mine from somebody else's.
