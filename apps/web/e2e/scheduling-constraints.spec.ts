/**
 * The scheduling rules an organiser STORES, proven on the board (#452).
 *
 * Why this file exists at all. Four defects — #443, #446, #447 and the #457
 * repair rounding — shipped past a fully green suite, and every one of them had
 * the same shape: a rule that compiles, displays as enforced, and binds
 * nothing. None was reachable from e2e, for two structural reasons:
 *
 *   1. **No UI writes `constraints.hard`.** Verified again while writing this
 *      file: `grep -a -rn "constraints.hard"` over `src/components` and
 *      `src/app` returns nothing. `constraints-panel.tsx` writes
 *      `crossPersonClash: "hard" | "warn"`, a different field entirely. So the
 *      rule has to be seeded through `PUT /api/v1/divisions/{id}/schedule-settings`
 *      and then ASSERTED on what the board renders. That split is deliberate:
 *      an API-only assertion would re-test the same usecase the unit suite
 *      already covers, and the surface the organiser is actually promised is
 *      the board's conflicts badge.
 *   2. **No spec created a pool-bearing stage.** `kind: "group"` with
 *      `config.pools.count > 1` is the only kind that writes `fixtures.pool_id`,
 *      and until this file nothing in `e2e/` created one — so a pool-targeted
 *      rule (#446) was unreachable.
 *
 * EVERY TEST HERE IS TWO-SIDED, and that is the whole design. A one-sided
 * "the badge appears" assertion is satisfied by a rule that binds nothing as
 * long as SOMETHING else on the board conflicts, and it is satisfied by a
 * board-wide rest floor that ignores the rule's scope entirely. So each test
 * renders the SAME board twice and changes exactly one thing — the stored rule
 * — and requires the badge to follow it in both directions.
 *
 * These conflicts are WARN-ONLY by design (`isBlockingConflict` in
 * packages/engine/src/scheduling/calendar.ts covers `court`, `person_overlap`,
 * `window` and direct `order` — not `rest`, not `instruction`). So nothing here
 * asserts a refused save, and each test additionally pins that no RED row
 * appears: a rest rule that started blocking writes would be a regression this
 * file should fail on.
