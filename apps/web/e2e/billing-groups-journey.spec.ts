// The multi-org billing workflow, walked end to end and photographed at every
// step (spec 2026-07-21 billing-groups).
//
// This file does the REAL moves — attach, detach, re-attach, hand over — through
// the UI, not through SQL. That is possible because every Stripe call in the
// model sits behind `hasLiveSubscription(...)`:
//   syncGroupQuantity returns before its first Stripe touch when the group is
//   not live; offerGroupTransfer's card handover is behind
//   `hasLiveSubscription(group) && group.stripe_customer_id` and its else branch
//   completes locally; cancelBillingGroup guards the same way.
// So a group with no `stripe_subscription_id` exercises the whole flow with no
// Stripe API call at all. What genuinely needs Stripe — an attach that CHARGES,
// the SetupIntent card handover, and seat arithmetic against a live
// subscription — stays in the mocked usecase suite.
//
// The screenshots are the deliverable as much as the assertions: each `shot`
// is taken immediately after the assertion that proves the state is real, so
// the walkthrough cannot show a screen the product does not actually produce.
//
// ORG BUDGET: owned orgs are a SHARED, run-wide budget — cap and reasoning in
// e2e/auth.setup.ts, "ORG BUDGET". This file mints TWO it reuses throughout,
// plus one transient org in step 02 (create-onto-an-existing-bill).
