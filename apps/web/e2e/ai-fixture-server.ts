// v4 Task 17 — AI model fixture server. Task 10 (openrouter-provider) added a
// second dialect on the same server.
//
// A tiny HTTP stand-in for both the Anthropic Messages API and OpenRouter's
// OpenAI-shaped chat completions API, so the AI Schedule Architect e2e never
// touches a real model on EITHER provider path. The Next server under test is
// pointed at it via SCHEDULING_AI_BASE_URL (Anthropic dialect) or
// OPENROUTER_BASE_URL (OpenRouter dialect) — see playwright.config.ts's
// webServer.env and the local run recipe in the spec. anthropicProvider() in
// anthropic-provider.ts POSTs `${baseURL}/v1/messages`; openRouterProvider() in
// openrouter-provider.ts POSTs `${baseURL}/chat/completions`. Which dialect
// the app actually speaks is chosen by AI_PROVIDER, not by anything this
// server does — both routes are always live here.
//
// How the SDK derives `parsed_output` (node_modules/@anthropic-ai/sdk/lib/
// parser.mjs → zodOutputFormat.parse): it JSON.parses the FIRST text content
// block's `.text` and runs the caller's zod schema over it. So a canned response
// is just a normal Messages envelope whose content is one text block carrying the
// JSON-stringified plan. A `stop_reason: "refusal"` (with no text block) drives
// the model-refusal error path.
//
// openRouterProvider() parses `choices[0].message.content` as a JSON string
// and validates it against the zod schema directly (no SDK helper), so the
// OpenRouter dialect below serialises the same plan into that string field.
// Its refusal signal is `choices[0].finish_reason === "content_filter"` OR a
// string `message.refusal` (see openrouter-provider.ts); this fixture drives
// the former, since that's the one confirmed live against a real refusal.
//
// The plan is derived from the request itself: the runner sends the whole
// deterministic context pack as a user message (JSON.stringify(pack)) — the
// first message on the Anthropic dialect, or the first non-system message on
// the OpenRouter dialect (whose body prepends a system message carrying the
// cache breakpoint; see openrouter-request.ts) — and the pack already carries
// a `draft` — an engine-legal greedy solution over every movable fixture.
// Echoing that draft as the assignments yields a plan the server-side engine
// verifier passes as CLEAN, over whatever ids the seed minted.
//
// #398 (W3) added a THIRD request shape on this same dialect/endpoint: the
// stage-1 instruction compile, sent ahead of the schedule/joint-schedule call
// whenever the organiser's textarea is non-empty. It has neither `draft` nor
// `fixtures`, so it is recognised by its own `{instruction, context}` shape
// and tagged phase "parse" (see `ParseRequestLite` below) rather than falling
// through to "schedule" — the parse call always fires first, so leaving it
// misclassified would make it shadow the real schedule call under
// `calls.find(c => c.phase === "schedule")`.

 * minutes and `validateAssignments`'s milliseconds agree by construction. That
 * is precisely the blind spot #457 lived in: an obstacle ending at 10:00:20
 * rounded DOWN to 10:00, so z3 permitted a start that overlapped it by twenty
 * seconds and the verifier rejected the board the solver had just proved clean.
 * No minute-aligned board can express that disagreement.
 *
 * WHAT IS OFFSET, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE CLASH PAIR. The clash stays byte-for-byte
 * what `FIXTURE_CLASH` produces; every draft card FROM THE THIRD ON is shifted
 * instead. Two reasons, both measured rather than assumed:
 *
 *   * The cards that are not in the clash have no reason to move, so they are
 *     what the solver has to route the repaired card AROUND — the obstacle
 *     rounding that #457 was actually about. They also come out the far end
 *     still carrying their seconds, which is what makes the spec's assertion on
 *     the applied board deterministic rather than a coin flip on which of two
 *     interchangeable cards z3 picked.
 *   * Offsetting the clash pair itself was tried first and is worse in a way
 *     worth recording: the board then repairs with `data-moved="2"` and
 *     `data-minimality="upper_bound"` (both clash cards land in the free tail
 *     of the day, minute-aligned, and no sub-minute value survives at all),
 *     where the whole-minute clash proves a single move. So that variant tests
 *     neither minimal repair nor sub-minute survival.
 *
 * Sub-minute instants are reachable from the product, not invented here:
 * `AddFixture.scheduled_at` is a client-supplied RFC-3339 string with no
 * seconds restriction, the single-move PATCH stores it verbatim, and the AI
 * usecase feeds `Date.parse` straight into `Assignment.startAt`.
 *
 * The sentinel deliberately CONTAINS `FIXTURE_CLASH`, so a body carrying it
 * takes the clash path too; the offset is the only difference.

 * order the model proposed, over real HTTP, through the real pack the
