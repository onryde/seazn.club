// still printed green — the suite read as coverage it was not providing.
// Load the canonical repo-root .env.local (apps/web/.env.local symlinks to it)
// so a bare `npx vitest run` exercises them.
//
// A missing file is not fatal: CI ships no .env.local and supplies DATABASE_URL
// / REDIS_URL through the job environment instead. Node's loader never
// overwrites an already-set variable, so an exported value (or CI's) still wins.

// …but the file is a DEVELOPER's env, so it also carries live third-party
// credentials, and a unit test that quietly calls a real vendor is worse than
// one that skips. Drop the outbound ones the suite has always run without:
//
//   POSTHOG*  — posthog-server.ts reads the key at module load with
//               flushAt:1/flushInterval:0, so every captureServer() awaits a
//               real HTTPS round-trip. With the key present, org-posts'
//               22- and 25-post pagination tests blew the 5s timeout, and the
//               run was shipping fake events into the live project.
//               posthog-server.test.ts already documents "unconfigured" as the
//               contract for CI and local test.
//   RESEND_API_KEY   — lib/email.ts:110 send() only no-ops WITHOUT a key; the
//               suites that don't mock @/lib/email say so explicitly ("no-op
//               without RESEND_API_KEY either way"). With one, they mail out.
//   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY — every AI test sets its own dummy key; a real one just
//               means a slipped path bills us. The one live bench
//               (schedule-ai-effort-ab.live.test.ts, AI_AB_LIVE=1) reads
//               .env.local itself, so it is unaffected.
//
//   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY — "the rest mock the Stripe module" is not true. Five
//               suites reference Stripe unmocked, and two use KEYLESSNESS ITSELF
//               as the mechanism under test:
//                 sponsor-dispute.test.ts        — "the keyless test env makes
//                   getStripe() throw, so recovery takes its audited failure path"
//                 sponsor-order-delete-guards.test.ts — "a clean 409 also proves
//                   the guard fired before any Stripe call"
//               With a key present, dispute-recovery.ts:63-64 constructs a client
//               and awaits stripe.charges.retrieve() on a fabricated id — a real
//               HTTPS call per run. It throws, the catch at :100 writes the same
//               `dispute_recovery_failed` audit the test asserts, and the suite
//               stays green for entirely the wrong reason. The delete-guard test
//               is worse: if that guard ever regressed it would now attempt a
//               REAL refund instead of throwing a config error.
//               Kept only under BILLING_LIVE=1, because billing-proration.live
//               documents an invocation that sources the key from this file.

// run` exercises the DB suites, and every suite gates on
// `const HAS_DB = !!process.env.DATABASE_URL`. So a run with nothing exported

// to silently skipping ~700 tests while still exiting 0, which this file's own
// header calls out as "coverage it was not providing".
