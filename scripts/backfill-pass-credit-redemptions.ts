// One-off backfill for pass_credit_redemptions (V335, design 2026-07-26 §2).
//
// V335's lifetime cap (`pass_credit_redemptions_group_cap`) only sees
// redemptions written AFTER the table existed. A group that already redeemed
// an Event Pass credit BEFORE V335 shipped has no row, so the cap reads
// clean for it — and it can mint one more real credit, on a different pass,
// the moment it's deployed. This script closes that gap once, up front.
//
// The only durable record of a pre-V335 credit is the Stripe balance
// transaction itself: `creditPassTowardSubscription`
// (apps/web/src/server/usecases/pass-credit.ts) always stamps
// `metadata[pass_payment_intent]` (PASS_CREDIT_INTENT_KEY) and
// `metadata.org_id` on the transaction it creates — the same data
// `alreadyCredited` already reads back. This script walks every subscription
// with a `stripe_customer_id`, lists that customer's balance transactions,
// and reconstructs a redemption row from any transaction carrying that
// metadata.
//
// A group that (pre-V335) collected MORE THAN ONE pass credit is the exact
// stacking bug this whole feature exists to close, and it cannot be fixed
// retroactively here — Stripe has already paid out both. This script inserts
// exactly ONE row per group (the earliest credit, which is the one that
// should have capped it) to close the cap going forward, and prints a loud
// warning for every group where more than one was found, for staff to
// reconcile by hand.
//
// Idempotent / safe to re-run any number of times:
//   - a group that already holds a redemption row the lifetime cap counts
//     (live, or reversed-but-undetermined) is skipped outright
//   - every insert is `on conflict (payment_intent) do nothing`
//
// DRY RUN by default: prints every row it would insert (and every anomaly it
// found) without writing anything. Pass --write to actually insert.
