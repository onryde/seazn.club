// Sync Stripe products/prices from apps/web/src/config/stripe-plans.json into
// Stripe + the `plans` table. Idempotent: a price is matched by its stable
// `lookup_key`, so re-running never duplicates. Stripe price amounts AND the
// pricing structure itself (per_unit vs tiered) are immutable, so when the JSON
// drifts from the live price the script mints a REPLACEMENT price (carrying the
// lookup_key via transfer_lookup_key) and archives the old one — that is the
// sanctioned way to roll out a price change. Existing subscriptions keep their
// original price id (Task 8 sync guards), so no one is repriced mid-term.
//
// Billing groups: a paid subscription covers a GROUP of organisations, and the
// subscription's `quantity` is the number of orgs in it. Those plans are priced
// with graduated tiers — tier 1 is the base rate, tier 2+ is an extra org at
// half — so this script sends billing_scheme/tiers_mode/tiers when the seed has
// them. Flat prices (the one-time Event Pass) keep the plain unit_amount shape.
