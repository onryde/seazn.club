# Prompt 06b: Status vocabulary translation

**Context**: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-07-placement-scheduler-design.md`,
section "Status vocabulary translation — owned by TS, not the contract"
and section "UI / wire-surface impact" — the visible copy is ALREADY
engine-neutral (checked all 4 locale dictionaries: `board.result.engine.z3`
renders as "Solver"/"Solveur"/"Solucionador", never literally "z3"), so
this prompt adds one new engine label and one new status case, it does
not rewrite existing user-facing copy.

**Acceptance criteria**: CP-SAT's native status
(`OPTIMAL/FEASIBLE/INFEASIBLE/UNKNOWN/ERROR`) maps to a `BuildStatus`
value per the table below, concretely resolving what the design doc
left open. The new `"optimized"` engine label renders the same neutral
"Solver" copy the existing `"z3"` label already uses, in all 4 locales.

**Do not touch**: the existing `z3`/`z3+lns`/`z3_unavailable` values —
additive only, they're removed in Prompt 10, not renamed here.

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/engine/src/scheduling/build.ts` (status mapping, adjacent to Prompt 06's change), `apps/web/src/components/v2/board/result-strip.tsx`, `apps/web/src/dictionaries/{en,es,fr,nl}/ui.json`
- Test: `packages/engine/src/scheduling/build.test.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/v2/board/__tests__/result-strip.test.tsx` (additions to both)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: CP-SAT's native status from `placement-client.ts` (Prompt 05).
- Produces: the existing `BuildStatus` union (`build.ts:387`) gets one new value, `"solver_unavailable"`.

Mapping decided (do not re-derive): `UNKNOWN` → `not_searched` (both
mean "nothing proven, don't claim otherwise" — closest semantic match).
`ERROR` → new `"solver_unavailable"` (not reusing `z3_unavailable` —
that string is invisible to users per the design doc's finding, but the
identifier itself is misleading once z3 is gone; cheaper to add one
clean value now than carry a stale name forward). `INFEASIBLE` →
`infeasible` (same semantics, a real proof). `OPTIMAL`/`FEASIBLE` → `ok`
or `already_optimal` per the existing rule already in `build.ts`
(unchanged logic, just fed by CP-SAT's numbers now).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

> **The sample below uses a mocking style that does not work in this file
> — read this before copying it.** (Checked 2026-08-09.)
>
> `build.test.ts` mocks with `vi.doMock(...)` + `vi.importActual` (see
> its `./calendar.ts` and `./z3-load.ts` mocks), not
> `vi.spyOn(await import(...))`. An ESM module namespace object is
> sealed, so spying on it is not the idiom that works here.
>
> Worse, there is a recorded trap in this repo: **`vi.doMock` is INERT if
> the file under test also imports the module STATICALLY.** It has
> previously passed 5/5 with the guard deleted. `z3-load.ts` is mockable
> today precisely because `build.ts` loads it dynamically.
>
> So whether module mocking works here at all depends on how Prompt 06
> imports `placement-client.ts` — a decision made in the task before this one.
>
> **Prefer injection over mocking.** Prompt 05 shipped a seam for exactly
> this: the call object is an internal third argument to `solveBuild`,
> and `SolveBuildOptions` is wire-free. Feeding a fake through that seam
> tests the mapping without depending on module-mock semantics at all.
> If you do use `vi.doMock`, prove it is live: make the mock return a
> value the real path cannot produce, and confirm the test fails when the
> mapping is deleted. A green mapping test that never invoked your mock
> is the failure mode this whole programme has been fighting.

```typescript
describe("Placement status -> BuildStatus mapping", () => {
  it.each([
    ["UNKNOWN", "not_searched"],
    ["ERROR", "solver_unavailable"],
    ["INFEASIBLE", "infeasible"],
  ] as const)("%s maps to %s", async (placementStatus, expected) => {
    // See the note above — inject rather than spying on the namespace.
    const result = await buildSchedule(minimalBuildInput());
    expect(result.status).toBe(expected);
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify it fails**

Run: `cd packages/engine && npx vitest run src/scheduling/build.test.ts -t "status -> BuildStatus"`
Expected: FAIL — `solver_unavailable` doesn't exist on the type yet, mapping not implemented.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add `"solver_unavailable"` to `BuildStatus` and implement the mapping**

Add the new literal to the `BuildStatus` union at `build.ts:387`
(additive — do not remove `z3_unavailable`, it may still be referenced
by REFLOW's own status handling until that's a separate, later
decision). Implement the switch mapping CP-SAT's status into the
function's existing status-assignment point.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify it passes**

Run: `cd packages/engine && npx vitest run src/scheduling/build.test.ts`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Update the UI's `statusKey()` switch and add the engine label**

Modify `apps/web/src/components/v2/board/result-strip.tsx`'s
`statusKey()` (line ~42) to add `case "solver_unavailable"` returning
the **existing** i18n key `"board.result.unavailable"` (the current
z3_unavailable copy — "does not promise a retry will help" — is equally
true for a Placement outage; same key, new case, no new string needed
here). Add `"optimized": "board.result.engine.optimized"` to `ENGINE_KEY`
(line 33) — this **is** a new string; add the key to all 4 dictionaries
(`apps/web/src/dictionaries/{en,es,fr,nl}/ui.json`) with the same
copy the existing `z3` key already uses in each locale ("Solver" /
"Solveur" / "Solucionador" / NL equivalent).

- [ ] **Step 6: Write and run a UI test**

> **The sample below is VACUOUS — do not ship it.** (Checked 2026-08-09.)
> `expect(html).toContain("Solver")` is exactly the assertion that file
> already documents as broken. Its own comment, above the `provenance()`
> helper, says: *"'Solver' is a prefix of 'Solver, then refined', so a
> substring check can be satisfied by the wrong label."* And `toContain`
> over the WHOLE html matches the word anywhere on the page, not just in
> the provenance line — so it would also pass on a blank engine key.
>
> Use the file's existing `provenance(html)` helper, which extracts the
> provenance line and strips React's SSR comment markers, and assert the
> label EXACTLY. Prove it: render `engine: "z3"` and confirm your placement
> assertion fails against it.

```typescript
// apps/web/src/components/v2/board/__tests__/result-strip.test.tsx (addition)
it("placement engine renders the same neutral 'Solver' copy as z3 did", () => {
  const html = render(metrics(), solver({ engine: "optimized", status: "ok" }));
  expect(provenance(html)).toMatch(/^Solver · /);   // exact, not toContain
});
```

Run: `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/v2/board/__tests__/result-strip.test.tsx`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/engine/src/scheduling/build.ts apps/web/src/components/v2/board/result-strip.tsx apps/web/src/dictionaries apps/web/src/components/v2/board/__tests__/result-strip.test.tsx
git commit -m "feat: translate placement's native status vocabulary into BuildStatus, add placement engine label"
```

**Verify**: `cd packages/engine && npx vitest run src/scheduling/build.test.ts` AND `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/components/v2/board/__tests__/result-strip.test.tsx` → both suites fully green. Also run this repo's i18n drift gate: `npm run i18n:gen-keys && git status --porcelain` must be empty after — a key added to one locale and not another is exactly what this gate exists to catch.

**Output cap**: final message under 15 lines — pass counts for both suites, confirm i18n drift gate is clean, confirm all 4 locales have the new key.
