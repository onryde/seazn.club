# ScoringPad v3 — wave index

**One wave per session.** Read `_RULES.md`, then this file, then the wave's
prompt. This file is the compaction anchor: every ruling, false premise and
status change is written here **as it happens**.

Design of record: `../2026-08-15-scoringpad-v3-redesign-design.md` (committed
`8480e725`). Evidence: baseline gallery
<https://claude.ai/code/artifact/afdf2a1a-33d5-41d6-9b94-a485ced418b6>, tap-model
comps <https://claude.ai/code/artifact/c96496b9-4231-482a-85a0-d913cc25788b>.

## Order

Main chain is sequential R1→R8 (each conversion consumes R1's primitives;
R4 owes R5 nothing, but keeping one wave in flight at a time is the rule —
one PR per wave, visual sign-off gate on each).

| Wave | Prompt file | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | `R1-chassis.md` + plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-15-scorepad-v3-r1-chassis.md` | — | TODO |
| R2 | `R2-cricket.md` | R1 | TODO |
| R3 | `R3-football.md` | R1 | TODO |
| R4 | `R4-tennis.md` | R1 | TODO |
| R5 | `R5-racquet-split.md` | R1 | TODO |
| R6 | `R6-period-pair.md` | R1 | TODO |
| R7 | `R7-universal-console.md` | R1 (chrome parts benefit from R2–R6 but do not block) | TODO |
| R8 | `R8-sweep.md` | R2–R7 | TODO |

## Rulings carried in (do not re-litigate — full text in spec §0)

- v3 regardless; v1 tap feel is the foundation; 11 per-sport skins on the
  shared chassis; HYBRID tap model (S: tennis/badminton/tabletennis/
  volleyball/boardgame/generic · T: cricket/football/hockey/icehockey/carrom).
- Daylight shell + stadium-night LCD scorebug; ribbon + ~6s soft-commit dock.
- One pad both surfaces; console = authority chrome; device link bare,
  day-scoped, cannot finalize.
- Fidelity ladder CLOSED 0–3, no second vocabulary (v2 S2/#430 ruling).
- Visual sign-off gate per wave (gallery + walkthrough) — merge-blocking.
- Spec §8 defect register D-1…D-19: rows close with their named wave or the
  skip reason is recorded HERE.

## Decision log

Append one line per ruling: date, wave, decision, reason. Never delete.

- 2026-08-15 — programme — created from the approved spec; R1 plan written
  at code level, R2–R8 as briefs whose sessions re-pin (v2's proven
  mechanism; pre-written line numbers go stale, see v2 `_INDEX.md` §"State
  of the world").
- 2026-08-15 — programme — capture recipe traps recorded in `_RULES.md` §2
  (page.request cookie jar, no networkidle, cookie banner, animations
  disabled) — paid for during the baseline capture, do not re-derive.
