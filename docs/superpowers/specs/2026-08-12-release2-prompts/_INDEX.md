# Release 2 (scheduling) — session index

**One session per row.** Read `_RULES.md`, then this file, then the session's
prompt file. This file is the compaction anchor: every ruling, false premise,
and status change gets written here **as it happens**.

> **Naming collision warning:** `C#` here numbers *release-2* sessions. It is
> NOT the #21 contract programme's C-task numbering (C1/C4/C6) that
> `services/placement/src/placement/model.py` docstrings and
> `proto/scheduler.proto` comments cite. When a code comment says "task C2/C4/C6",
> it means the #21 programme, never this index.

## Order

Main chain sequential (shared files: `proto/scheduler.proto`, `build.ts`,
`model.py`, `schedule.ts`). C3 is a near-disjoint lane but overlaps
`schedule.ts` with C1 — run it strictly before or after C1, never alongside.
C6 (prose) is safe whenever.

| Session | Prompt file | Spec | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C0 | `C0-division-rules-retirement.md` | division_rules | — | TODO |
| C1 | `C1-round-ordering.md` | round ordering | C0 (same proto/build.ts region) | TODO |
| C2 | `C2-day-start-rung.md` | day_start | C1 (model.py overlap; rebase either way) | TODO |
| C3 | `C3-conflict-detail-names.md` | conflict details | not concurrent with C1 (schedule.ts) | TODO |
| C4 | `C4-z3-reflow-cpsat.md` | z3 stage A | C1 (reflow inherits round rule) | TODO |
| C5 | `C5-z3-ai-repair-cpsat.md` | z3 stage B | C4 | TODO |
| C6 | `C6-z3-prose-identifiers.md` | z3 stage C | — (anytime) | TODO |
| C7 | `C7-z3-public-contract.md` | z3 stage D | C4+C5 **deployed** (nothing writes z3) | TODO |
| C8 | `C8-z3-delete-solver.md` | z3 stage E | C7 | TODO |

## Decisions already made (do not re-open)

- Round order: **lexicographic** (day ≤, then same-day start ≤); pin–pin
  exempt; pin–movable enforced (honest INFEASIBLE accepted vs C4 clamp
  precedent); **round-robin fixtures only** carry rounds — brackets rely on
  dependency edges.
- `day_start` = Σ(day_lo − day_open) over used days, chain position after
  `day_span`; TIER_COUNT → 6.
- z3: all four jobs approved; stored rows **rewrite** `z3|z3+lns → optimized`
  (UI copy already identical); repair enum end state `none|optimized|llm`.
- Conflict details: **structured** (`{kind, ids…}`), localized client-side in
  all 4 dicts; legacy `detail` string derived at API layer, deprecated.
- division_rules: one PR, full kill; both deploy orders proven safe; prod
  placement already on the rule_groups contract (owner-confirmed 2026-08-12).

## Status log

(append here as sessions run)

### C0 — division_rules retirement (started 2026-08-12)

Branch `feat/c0-division-rules-retirement`, worktree
`.claude/worktrees/c0-division-rules`. Re-pinned every `file:line` in the C0
prompt against `989e0ba8` before dispatch; two of them had drifted and one
premise was wrong:

- **False premise (prompt + spec):** "`build.ts` — remove emission". `build.ts`
  never names field 10. The emission is
  `placement-client.ts:254 toDivisionRules()`, fed from
  `SolveBuildInput.constraints.restByDivision` / `dayCapByDivision`. `build.ts`
  only *populates those two constraint fields* (1707-1714) and carries stale
  doc prose.
- **Drift:** `build.ts` doc-comment block is **1134-1150** (prompt said
  1131-1144) and the emission-site comment is **1703-1705** (prompt said 1700).
  A third stale note lives at **1625**. Proto `DivisionRule` is **165-176**
  with its lead comment from **159** (prompt said 159-174), and stale
  `division_rules` prose also sits at **127-129** and **162**, which neither
  the prompt nor the spec listed.

**Ruling (orchestrator, in scope):** `restByDivision` / `dayCapByDivision` on
`SolveBuildInput["constraints"]` exist *only* to feed field 10, so they die
with it — along with their division-index registration
(`placement-client.ts:547-553`) and the `dayCapByDivision > 0` validation
(`637-641`). The prompt's "do not touch `BuildConstraints`" reads as the
**proto** message (`match_minutes` / `gap_minutes`), not this TS shape; the
prompt separately authorises "the wire type/encoding in `placement-client.ts`
if it names the field", and it does. `restByDivisionForWire` and
`dayCapsByDivision()` stay as *internal* values — `restByDivisionForWire` still
feeds `buildRuleGroups`.

Open question carried into review: dropping the index registration can shrink
`division_count` on a board where a division is named by a rest/cap rule but by
no fixture. `division_count` is a declared bound only, so that is a wire change
without a behavior change — but it must be stated, not hidden.

**Implementation complete (2026-08-12).** Resolution of the open question above:
`division_count` CAN shrink for a board where a division was named only by a
rest/cap rule and by no fixture — that source is gone (division_rules is the
only field that ever fed it). No real caller hits this: `build.ts` always
derives `SolveBuildInput.constraints` from the same fixtures it also sends, so
every division a rest/cap rule ever named was already named by a fixture too.
Wire change, not a behavior change, as anticipated.

Additional blast radius beyond the file set the prompt named, all necessary
fallout from the change it authorized (detailed in the implementer's own
report): `services/placement/tests/test_proto_compiles.py` (drift gate — the
generated stubs would not even compile without updating the field contract;
added the required reserved-field test here too), `_board_positional.py`
(`to_proto_request` constructed `scheduler_pb2.DivisionRule`, which no longer
exists — converted its rest/cap translation to `rule_groups`, added a new
`rule_groups_for` helper), `test_schema.py`/`test_server.py` (same — DivisionRule
no longer exists; deleted 10 division_rules-exclusive test IDs, confirmed
equivalent rule_groups-path coverage already existed for each), and
`test_model.py` (deleted 6 more test IDs whose premise was the retired dict
keys; converted 4 tests in the "SEVENTH fold" section from a division-baseline
framing to a pure rule_groups one; **found and fixed two real regressions** —
`test_the_day_cap_groups_by_the_callers_day_index_not_by_utc` and
`test_two_day_indices_over_one_utc_day_give_two_buckets` were still sourcing
their day cap from the now-dead `constraints.day_cap_by_division`, and
`test_production_board_meets_the_stated_acceptance_criterion` silently became
an uncapped, harder-to-optimize board once `_production_board()` stopped
carrying rule_groups — fixed by making `_production_board()` derive and
propagate `rule_groups` via a new `rule_groups_for` helper in
`_board_positional.py`, threaded through every solve-invoking caller). Also
added, per an owner requirement folded in mid-task: structured logging
(`schema.py`'s `_log_legacy_wire_fields`) for a deploy-window request still
carrying field 10, plus its own test pair.

Verified: engine vitest 3516/3538 passed, 0 failed, 22 pre-existing pending
(z3/WASM-gated, unrelated); `test:coverage` green, `src/core/**` at 100%
lines; engine lint and tsc both clean.

**False premise, caught by review, not by the implementer:** the first pass
reported placement pytest as 213/220 with 7 failures in `test_objective.py`
dismissed as "pre-existing load-sensitivity flakes." Wrong — the coordinator
re-ran it twice (once on a quiet box, byte-identical results, ~43s each) and
showed the numbers were a real, deterministic defect: `T1_PROVED_MAKESPAN_MS`
expected `1_557_600_000` (~18 days, the 1/day cap binding), got `26_400_000`
(~7.3 hours) — a 59x compression no slow machine produces, a missing day cap
does exactly. `test_objective.py`'s `_production_board()`/`_model_for()`/
`_model_without_pins()` were the SAME class of bug already found and fixed in
`test_model.py` (see above) but never applied to this sibling file — `grep -c
rule_groups tests/test_objective.py` was 0. The `load1=…` hint those tests
print fires whenever `tiers_completed < 4` for ANY reason, which is what made
a structural defect read as environmental noise. Fixed the same way:
`rule_groups=rule_groups_for(<raw board>)` threaded through all three
helpers and both local `imbalance_probe_board()` construction sites (7-tuple
vs the now-8-tuple `_production_board()` shape had to match). Placement
pytest is 220/220 now, 0 failed (`test_objective.py` alone: 21/21) — and
notably ~3x faster (18.9s vs ~55s), consistent with a correctly-capped board
being an EASIER packing problem, exactly as the coordinator's diagnosis said.
None of the three proved-optimum constants (`T1_PROVED_MAKESPAN_MS` etc.)
needed to move — confirmed by diff, only context lines touch their names.

Golden
corpus: 474/474 `testkit/golden*.test.ts` passed, and `git status --porcelain`
on all 11 `*.golden.json` fixtures is empty — byte-identical (scheduling code
is outside the corpus's scope entirely). `openapi:gen` produced zero diff.
