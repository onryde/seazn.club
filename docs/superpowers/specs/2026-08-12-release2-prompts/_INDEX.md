## Order

Main chain sequential (shared files: `proto/scheduler.proto`, `build.ts`,
`model.py`, `schedule.ts`). C3 is a near-disjoint lane but overlaps
`schedule.ts` with C1 — run it strictly before or after C1, never alongside.
C6 (prose) is safe whenever.

| Session | Prompt file | Spec | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C0 | `C0-division-rules-retirement.md` | division_rules | — | **MERGED** #537 → `f0f83939` |
| C1 | `C1-round-ordering.md` | round ordering | C0 (same proto/build.ts region) | **MERGED** #546 → `78db2f1f` |
| C2 | `C2-day-start-rung.md` | day_start | C1 (model.py overlap; rebase either way) | **IN REVIEW** — PR #555, `feat/c2-day-start-rung`; shipped #512's two rungs too (see below) |

### C1 — round ordering (2026-08-12/13, DONE)

Branch `feat/c1-round-ordering`, 30 commits, rebased onto `03c3c2d0`.

**Prompt/spec drift found by scout re-pin (7 of 11 citations exact, 4 wrong):**
the prompt's "C0 already reserved field 10" reads as if on `Fixture`, but the
`reserved 10` is on `SolveBuildRequest`; `build.ts`'s emission is 1627-1633,
not 1649-1653; `model.py`'s `on_day` is 863-871 and its day derivation
824-837, not 875/842-870; `roundrobin.ts`'s `roundNo` is computed at :103,
not :41. The spec never named the TS verifier — it is `validateAssignments`
(`calendar.ts`), with `Assignment` at :79-88.

**Ruling — the spec's "same-division pair" was UNDERSTATED.** The comparable
unit is one round SEQUENCE, keyed `(division, stage, pool)`. A `group` stage
calls `generateRoundRobin` once per POOL, and entitlements permit several
league/group STAGES per division; each restarts at round 1. Both cases were
hit by real boards, not hypothesised. Spec amended in this PR.

**Six enforcement seams, five of them found only because someone swept.** The
prompt named one. Round order is now enforced at: `autoSchedule` preview,
`applySchedule` write gate, `validateScheduleIn` (publish / `startDivision` /
live conflict report), `moveFixture` + `applySchedule`'s partial path (the
delta gate compared ONE fixture against `existing`, so a one-element set could
never contain a pair — structural, not a missing parameter), the AI planning
path (`SchedulePack`/`CompetitionPack` now carry stage identity), and joint
multi-division apply.

**Ruling — joint apply gets `tz` WITHOUT the `rules` bundle.** `verifyConfigFor`
withholds typed-rule inputs from the apply path deliberately (#399: apply-time
blocking is W4). `tz` is merely bundled with them. It now takes an independent
`tz?: string` 4th param, mirroring `window`. `AI_VERIFY_POLICY.hard = false`
structurally keeps `effectiveHard` at `[]` for any caller omitting `rules`, so
#399 cannot leak through the new seam.

**Accepted, unchanged:** z3 REFLOW/AI-repair can still emit round-violating
boards — the verifier catches them and REFLOW degrades gracefully instead of
500ing (`RepairVerificationError` is caught). Closing it is C4/C5's job.
Owner ruled 2026-08-13 that C1 ships without waiting (greenfield, no prod
users). z3 benchmarks ruled out of scope entirely.

**Lesson for C2–C8:** two of the six seams were missed by trusting an
inherited call-site list (a doc comment, then a report). Sweep with
`git grep -n "toAssignment("` — never inherit an enumeration.

### C6 — z3 prose (2026-08-13): NO-OP today, ordering was wrong

Classified every z3 reference (~1554 hits, ~140 files): ~70 are C7's
persisted/public values, ~835 are C8's solver/tests/WASM/env, ~649 are
history. **Zero are C6's.** Stage C renames prose that says z3 "where the code
no longer means z3", but REFLOW and AI repair still genuinely call z3, so every
surviving identifier is accurate; `build.ts:300-306` already carries an earlier
session's comment pre-empting this rename. C6 must run AFTER C4+C5.
`content/help/**` has zero z3 hits and never owed an edit. Finding recorded on
branch `feat/c6-z3-prose` (`b5ade286`), parked.

## Decisions already made (do not re-open)

- Round order: **lexicographic** (day ≤, then same-day start ≤); pin–pin
  exempt; pin–movable enforced (honest INFEASIBLE accepted vs C4 clamp
  precedent); **round-robin fixtures only** carry rounds — brackets rely on
  dependency edges.
- `day_start` = Σ(day_lo − day_open) over used days, chain position after
  `day_span`; TIER_COUNT → 6.
- z3: all four jobs approved; stored rows **rewrite** `z3|z3+lns → optimized`
  (UI copy already identical); repair enum end state `none|optimized|llm`.
- Conflict details: **structured** (`{kind, ids…}`), localized client-side in
  all 4 dicts; legacy `detail` string derived at API layer, deprecated.
- division_rules: one PR, full kill; both deploy orders proven safe; prod
  placement already on the rule_groups contract (owner-confirmed 2026-08-12).

## Status log

(append here as sessions run)

### C0 — division_rules retirement (started 2026-08-12)

Branch `feat/c0-division-rules-retirement`, worktree
`.claude/worktrees/c0-division-rules`. Re-pinned every `file:line` in the C0
prompt against `989e0ba8` before dispatch; two of them had drifted and one
premise was wrong:

- **False premise (prompt + spec):** "`build.ts` — remove emission". `build.ts`
  never names field 10. The emission is
  `placement-client.ts:254 toDivisionRules()`, fed from
  `SolveBuildInput.constraints.restByDivision` / `dayCapByDivision`. `build.ts`
  only *populates those two constraint fields* (1707-1714) and carries stale
  doc prose.
- **Drift:** `build.ts` doc-comment block is **1134-1150** (prompt said
  1131-1144) and the emission-site comment is **1703-1705** (prompt said 1700).
  A third stale note lives at **1625**. Proto `DivisionRule` is **165-176**
  with its lead comment from **159** (prompt said 159-174), and stale
  `division_rules` prose also sits at **127-129** and **162**, which neither
  the prompt nor the spec listed.

**Ruling (orchestrator, in scope):** `restByDivision` / `dayCapByDivision` on
`SolveBuildInput["constraints"]` exist *only* to feed field 10, so they die
with it — along with their division-index registration
(`placement-client.ts:547-553`) and the `dayCapByDivision > 0` validation
(`637-641`). The prompt's "do not touch `BuildConstraints`" reads as the
**proto** message (`match_minutes` / `gap_minutes`), not this TS shape; the
prompt separately authorises "the wire type/encoding in `placement-client.ts`
if it names the field", and it does. `restByDivisionForWire` and
`dayCapsByDivision()` stay as *internal* values — `restByDivisionForWire` still
feeds `buildRuleGroups`.

Open question carried into review: dropping the index registration can shrink
`division_count` on a board where a division is named by a rest/cap rule but by
no fixture. `division_count` is a declared bound only, so that is a wire change
without a behavior change — but it must be stated, not hidden.

**Implementation complete (2026-08-12).** Resolution of the open question above:
`division_count` CAN shrink for a board where a division was named only by a
rest/cap rule and by no fixture — that source is gone (division_rules is the
only field that ever fed it). No real caller hits this: `build.ts` always
derives `SolveBuildInput.constraints` from the same fixtures it also sends, so
every division a rest/cap rule ever named was already named by a fixture too.
Wire change, not a behavior change, as anticipated.

Additional blast radius beyond the file set the prompt named, all necessary
fallout from the change it authorized (detailed in the implementer's own
report): `services/placement/tests/test_proto_compiles.py` (drift gate — the
generated stubs would not even compile without updating the field contract;
added the required reserved-field test here too), `_board_positional.py`
(`to_proto_request` constructed `scheduler_pb2.DivisionRule`, which no longer
exists — converted its rest/cap translation to `rule_groups`, added a new
`rule_groups_for` helper), `test_schema.py`/`test_server.py` (same — DivisionRule
no longer exists; deleted 10 division_rules-exclusive test IDs, confirmed
equivalent rule_groups-path coverage already existed for each), and
`test_model.py` (deleted 6 more test IDs whose premise was the retired dict
keys; converted 4 tests in the "SEVENTH fold" section from a division-baseline
framing to a pure rule_groups one; **found and fixed two real regressions** —
`test_the_day_cap_groups_by_the_callers_day_index_not_by_utc` and
`test_two_day_indices_over_one_utc_day_give_two_buckets` were still sourcing
their day cap from the now-dead `constraints.day_cap_by_division`, and
`test_production_board_meets_the_stated_acceptance_criterion` silently became
an uncapped, harder-to-optimize board once `_production_board()` stopped
carrying rule_groups — fixed by making `_production_board()` derive and
propagate `rule_groups` via a new `rule_groups_for` helper in
`_board_positional.py`, threaded through every solve-invoking caller). Also
added, per an owner requirement folded in mid-task: structured logging
(`schema.py`'s `_log_legacy_wire_fields`) for a deploy-window request still
carrying field 10, plus its own test pair.

Verified: engine vitest 3516/3538 passed, 0 failed, 22 pre-existing pending
(z3/WASM-gated, unrelated); `test:coverage` green, `src/core/**` at 100%
lines; engine lint and tsc both clean.

**False premise, caught by review, not by the implementer:** the first pass
reported placement pytest as 213/220 with 7 failures in `test_objective.py`
dismissed as "pre-existing load-sensitivity flakes." Wrong — the coordinator
re-ran it twice (once on a quiet box, byte-identical results, ~43s each) and
showed the numbers were a real, deterministic defect: `T1_PROVED_MAKESPAN_MS`
expected `1_557_600_000` (~18 days, the 1/day cap binding), got `26_400_000`
(~7.3 hours) — a 59x compression no slow machine produces, a missing day cap
does exactly. `test_objective.py`'s `_production_board()`/`_model_for()`/
`_model_without_pins()` were the SAME class of bug already found and fixed in
`test_model.py` (see above) but never applied to this sibling file — `grep -c
rule_groups tests/test_objective.py` was 0. The `load1=…` hint those tests
print fires whenever `tiers_completed < 4` for ANY reason, which is what made
a structural defect read as environmental noise. Fixed the same way:
`rule_groups=rule_groups_for(<raw board>)` threaded through all three
helpers and both local `imbalance_probe_board()` construction sites (7-tuple
vs the now-8-tuple `_production_board()` shape had to match). Placement
pytest is 220/220 now, 0 failed (`test_objective.py` alone: 21/21) — and
notably ~3x faster (18.9s vs ~55s), consistent with a correctly-capped board
being an EASIER packing problem, exactly as the coordinator's diagnosis said.
None of the three proved-optimum constants (`T1_PROVED_MAKESPAN_MS` etc.)
needed to move — confirmed by diff, only context lines touch their names.

Golden
corpus: 474/474 `testkit/golden*.test.ts` passed, and `git status --porcelain`
on all 11 `*.golden.json` fixtures is empty — byte-identical (scheduling code
is outside the corpus's scope entirely). `openapi:gen` produced zero diff.

### C2 — T1 `day_start` rung (2026-08-13)

Branch `feat/c2-day-start-rung`, worktree `.claude/worktrees/c2-day-start`,
off `3d64222a`. **PR #555**, commit `ab4a1aee`.

**False premise, and it changed the scope: #512 WAS NEVER IMPLEMENTED.** The
C2 prompt reads as if the two day rungs already exist ("reusing #512's
`day_lo`", "TIER_COUNT → 6"). They do not. `f687c7d5 docs: design for the
day-aware T1 objective (#512) (#531)` is a **docs** commit — the design doc
merged, the code never landed. Ground truth on `main` before this session:
`objective.py:166` had `TIER_ORDER = (placed, makespan, idle_gap, imbalance)`,
`build.ts:194` had `TIER_COUNT = 4`, and `model.py` had no `day_used`/`day_lo`/
`day_hi`/`span` at all. `day_start` is therefore not buildable alone: its input
`day_lo` is `day_span`'s variable and its chain slot is directly below it. The
day_start design anticipated exactly this — "#512's 4→5 becomes 4→6 **if this
lands with it**".

**Owner ruling (asked before exceeding the file set, per §1):** one PR, both
specs, `TIER_COUNT` 4 → 6, `makespan` retired. And on the wall: ship, report
the numbers, the production wall is a separate decision.

**Prompt/spec drift found by re-pin (before writing any code):** `model.py`'s
day derivation is 833-871 and `on_day` 876-889 (prompt said ~842-870); the
proto `Tier` name list is `scheduler.proto:199` inside 197-208 (prompt said
192-198). The prompt's "the TS caller's tier list" does not exist — **TS never
keys on tier names at all**, only on the tier COUNT (`build.ts:194`,
`schedule.ts`'s `TIERS_TOTAL`, and a mirrored comment in
`generated/scheduler.ts`). So the "same string both sides" requirement is
satisfied by the proto comment plus the count, and there is no TS name table to
edit.

**Ruling — the redundant per-day floor is the whole reason T1 proves.**
`model.Add(span >= dur_ms).OnlyEnforceIf(day_used[d])` is redundant about any
real board (`day_hi >= s + dur` and `day_lo <= s` already imply it) and is
load-bearing for the DUAL bound: `day_used[d]` is implied BY `on_day`
one-directionally and never implies an occupant back, so the relaxation may
hold a day "used" with a span of nothing and `sum(span)`'s lower bound starts
at 0. Measured on the production board: **without it `day_span` was still
FEASIBLE at 180 s and never proved; with it, OPTIMAL in 1.0 s at the same
value (69 600 000)** — the incumbent had been optimal all along and could not
be proved. Same lever as T3's max/min equality: fix the dual bound, not the
search. Narrowing each day's variable domains to that day's own window was
tried first and did nothing measurable on its own (kept anyway — exact, and
cheap).

**Ruling — #512 §6b resolved as option (1), accept and document.** An
off-lattice pin belongs to no day, so under a per-day objective it is invisible
to T1 entirely. Consistent with C4, which already exempts it from day caps.
Pinned by `test_day_objective.py::test_an_off_lattice_pin_belongs_to_no_day_at_all`
so a future reader finds a decision rather than an accident.

**Wall: a real regression, reported not hidden.** Production board, N=6 per
side, same box, same board, 30 s wall:

| | before (4 rungs) | after (6 rungs) |
|---|---|---|
| total, min/median/max | 1131 / 1730 / 2073 ms | 7739 / 17657 / 19485 ms |
| `days` | — | 215 / 367 / 469 ms |
| `day_span` | — | 631 / 1237 / 1813 ms |
| `day_start` | — | 208 / 396 / 458 ms |
| `idle_gap` | 741 / **1348** / 1672 ms | 6337 / **14931** / 17665 ms |
| tiers proved | 4/4, 6 runs | 6/6, 6 runs |

**The new rungs are not the cost — they are ~2 s of it.** `idle_gap` is, and
the control run says why: `placed` + `idle_gap` alone, **no day rungs in the
chain at all**, costs 12 439 ms. The retired whole-board `makespan` freeze had
been doing `idle_gap`'s pruning as a side effect, so what the wall pays for is
removing that term, not adding these. Arm B (day rungs but no `day_start`) is
the SLOWEST of all at 30 704 ms, so `day_start` is not the culprit either.

Consequence at the 8 s production wall: the chain returns FEASIBLE with **four
of six** rungs proved — `placed` + all three day rungs, ~2.3 s median, never
above 3.5 s measured — and cuts `idle_gap` short. The day-aware objective
itself fits the wall comfortably; `tiersCompleted === TIER_COUNT` (TS's
`already_optimal` gate) will now rarely fire at 8 s on a board this size.
Follow-up candidate, NOT done here: give `idle_gap` a dual bound the way
`day_span` just got one.

**Re-baselines, all stated:** `T1_PROVED_MAKESPAN_MS` / `_PIN_FREE_MS` retired
with their term; `T2_PROVED_IDLE_GAP_MS` 132 600 000 → 170 400 000 (a
day-anchored board spreads one entrant's matches further apart — the
`day_start`-over-`idle_gap` trade, asserted directly);
`T3_PROVED_IMBALANCE_MS` unchanged. New: `days` 19, `day_span` 69 600 000,
`day_start` 0. `test_bench_contract.py` untouched and green — the BOARD did
not move. `PROBE_OPTIMAL_MAKESPAN_MS` renamed `PROBE_OPTIMAL_DAY_SPAN_MS`,
value unchanged (that board is one day, so the two quantities coincide).

**Unplanned fixes (in scope, recorded per §1):**
- `schedule.ts`'s `TIERS_TOTAL` was still a hand-written `4` whose own comment
  claimed it "MIRRORS `TIER_COUNT` ... which is module-private there" —
  already false when written (`build.ts` exports it precisely so this layer
  needs no copy, ruling R17). It now imports the constant. This is the exact
  drift the export existed to prevent, and it had already happened.
- Nine engine test stubs hardcoded `tiersCompleted: 4` meaning "a fully proved
  ladder", plus ten assertions on the literal `4`. All now `TIER_COUNT`. The
  one exception is `build-teardown.test.ts`, which `vi.doMock`s that very
  module graph — a static import there would load the module before the mock
  registers and silently make it inert — so it keeps a literal with the reason
  written next to it.

**Lesson for C3-C8, and it is the same one C1 recorded.** C1's was "never
inherit an enumeration". C2's is **never inherit a status**: this prompt, the
index row, and the spec header all read as though #512 had shipped, because a
DESIGN doc had merged under a PR number. `git log --oneline --grep` on the
issue number, and one `git grep` for a symbol the work would have created, is
the whole check.

**Bench script untouched, deliberately.** `bench/placement_bench.py` carries a
divergent copy of the model (its own `build_model`, its own tier vocabulary —
`idlegap`, not `idle_gap`) and #512 §9 puts de-duplicating it out of scope. The
C2 prompt's "`bench/` copy of the model **if** the #512 work duplicated the
chain there" is conditional and the condition is false: this change duplicated
nothing into it. The bench numbers above were measured against the SERVICE's
model and chain, which is what ships.
