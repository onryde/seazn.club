"""Board generation for the CP-SAT scheduling bench, extracted so the bench
sweep and the service's own tests drive the SAME generator instead of two
copies that drift.

Everything above `production_board()` is lifted verbatim out of
`cpsat_bench.py` — same constants, same dataclasses, same math. Read that
file's module docstring for WHY each of these shapes is what it is (lattice
re-spacing at `gcd(matchMinutes, gapMinutes)`, the `existing`/dependency
families being modeled at all, the `not_after` pin). `cpsat_bench.py` imports
these names back, so the sweep is unchanged by the move.

`production_board()` is the only new code here: it renders the sweep's
`prod-37x77k` point into the SERVICE's plain-Python argument shape
(`cp_sat.model.build_model`'s parameter list, which mirrors
`proto/scheduler.proto`'s `SolveBuildRequest`). It deliberately does NOT
introduce a second board generator — it calls `build_board` like the sweep
does and only translates the result.

# THE SAME VALUE, which is how a Critical survived four review rounds — an

# makes an int64->int32 narrowing of `Assignment.start_at_ms` invisible,

# MUST STAY MIDNIGHT-ALIGNED (`EPOCH_MS % DAY_MS == 0`), and
# `tests/test_bench_contract.py` fails if it ever stops being. This is not
# tidiness: `build_board` opens each session day at `EPOCH_MS + d*DAY_MS +
# OPEN_MS` and runs it for `spcd * TICKS_PER_COARSE_SLOT` ticks, while
# `day_index_of` below buckets the per-division day cap by `start_ms // DAY_MS`
# — a UTC day. An epoch offset from midnight slides the session day across a
# UTC midnight, so ONE session day maps to TWO cap buckets and the cap silently
# doubles. Measured on the production board at 2026-01-01T10:00:00Z
# (1767261600000): 27 buckets instead of 26, and the returned board puts two
# `d1` fixtures on session day 0 and two `d2` on session day 15 against a cap
# of 1 — while `test_model.py`'s day-cap assertion still passes, because it
# re-derives the same `// DAY_MS` bucket. See the Prompt 05b report.
#
# Prompt 05c moved that quotient OUT of `cp_sat.model` (the wire now carries a
# caller-resolved `Slot.day_index`, because a UTC bucket is the wrong one for
# any org away from UTC) and into `day_index_of` in this file. The requirement
# is unchanged and so is every measurement above — the corpus is a UTC corpus

    four placements. That is a COUNT, decided by T0 in milliseconds, and it
    does not depend on the wall, on which tiers completed, or on the day cap.

    Why this board has to exist. On `production_board()` the same mutation is
    only visible by luck: with 8 320 slots, 37 fixtures and a day cap of one
    per division per day, almost nothing is ever forced onto the same court
    close together, so a narrower court interval usually changes no placement
    at all. Re-measured across six runs at the production 8 s wall, the mutant
    was caught **2 times in 6** — and the kills correlated with the chain
    NOT completing, i.e. with a less-optimised board, not with a longer solve.
    A guard that fires two times in six is a coin flip that reads as a
    regression in CI, and it was the strongest evidence for the (incorrect)
    claim that a longer wall makes this family more detectable.

    Entrants are pairwise disjoint and rest is 0 so participant rest cannot
    bind; there is no day cap and no dependency. The court gap is measured
    alone.

    Seven fixtures all share one entrant, on seven courts, so court

    interval:

        rest enforced (width match + rest = 60 min)  ->  REST_PROBE_CAPACITY

    per day, participants are naturally spread out and a missing rest window
    usually changes no placement.

      * T0 places all four (six slots, four fixtures).

        courts in one tick — so both remaining layouts survive its freeze.

        matches, so there are no idle-gap pairs at all.

        maximising gives `PROBE_WORST_IMBALANCE_MS`. Both prove instantly.
