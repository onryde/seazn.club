"""The corpus contract: what board the service is actually tested against.

Every acceptance test in `test_model.py`, `test_objective.py` and
`test_server.py` drives `cpsat_bench_boards.production_board()`. Nothing
asserted anything about that board, so its shape was free to move. Two
measured consequences of that, and this file exists for both:

  * `test_model.py`'s module docstring claims "37 fixtures, 5 courts, 26 days
    x 5 courts x 64 ticks" and no assertion enforced it. `bench/` is a
    benchmark directory — its whole purpose is experiments — so raising
    `PROD_TARGET_SLOTS` for a sweep silently changes what the SERVICE is
    tested against. `35 <= len(assignments) <= 37` passes against almost any
    board of roughly this size.
  * the day cap is DERIVED (`max(1, ceil(37 / 2 / 26)) == 1`), not chosen, and
    it is what makes the day-cap constraint bind at all. A looser lattice
    loosens the cap's grip and the day-cap mutant stops being killed — a guard
    going vacuous with no test changing and nobody noticing.

Prompt 02 Step 2b told its implementer to run `pytest bench/` to confirm the
board extraction survived. `bench/` contains no `test_*.py` and `pyproject.toml`
sets no `testpaths`, so that command exits 5 ("no tests ran") and always would
have — the verification was vacuous when it was written, and nothing in
`tests/` imported `cpsat_bench` at all. The import test below is the real
version of it.

Nothing here solves anything: these are assertions about DATA, and the file
must stay fast enough that there is never a reason to skip it.

#:          OBSERVABLE. This is a real and separate bar: a corpus can sit above
#:          0 and still fit in int32 (any date before 1970-01-26), clearing
#:          bar 1 while staying blind to the narrowing.
#:
#: `MIN_REAL_EPOCH_MS` clears both, because it is itself far above `INT32_MAX`.
#: That makes bar 2 IMPLIED by bar 1 rather than independently checkable
#: against the data — so `min(starts) > INT32_MAX` would be unreachable behind
#: `min(starts) > MIN_REAL_EPOCH_MS` and is deliberately not asserted. What IS
#: asserted is the implication itself, on the constants, so that a future
#: attempt to "just lower the epoch floor a bit" trips immediately.
