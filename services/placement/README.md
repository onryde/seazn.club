# Placement scheduling service

gRPC service wrapping Google OR-Tools CP-SAT for the BUILD/POLISH scheduler.
`packages/engine/src/scheduling/build.ts` calls it through `placement-client.ts`,
the TS anti-corruption layer — see
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-07-placement-scheduler-design.md`](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-07-placement-scheduler-design.md)
for the design and [`DEPLOY.md`](./DEPLOY.md) for the production runbook.
[`bench/README.md`](./bench/README.md) covers the offline sweep this
service's own board generator (`bench/placement_bench_boards.py`) is shared with.

## Local dev (for integration tests)

Start the service:

```bash
cd services/placement
# First time only, or if venv/ does not exist yet. Plain `python3 -m venv`
# will NOT work here: this repo's system Python is 3.9.6 and this package
# declares `requires-python = ">=3.11"` (pyproject.toml) — use `uv` to get a
# venv on a Python new enough, downloading one if it has to:
uv venv --python 3.11 venv
venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
PLACEMENT_SERVICE_SECRET=dev-secret PLACEMENT_PORT=50051 venv/bin/python3 -m placement.main
```

It logs `placement service listening on :50051 (max_workers=4)` and then blocks
in the foreground — leave that terminal open, or background it yourself
(`... &`, noting the PID) if you need the terminal back.

In another terminal, run the TS integration suite against it. There is no
`test:integration` script in `packages/engine/package.json` — this is the
direct `vitest` invocation:

```bash
cd packages/engine
PLACEMENT_SERVICE_HOST=localhost:50051 PLACEMENT_SERVICE_SECRET=dev-secret \
  npx vitest run src/scheduling/__tests__/placement-integration.test.ts
```

Without `PLACEMENT_SERVICE_HOST` set, that same suite SKIPS instead of dialing
the production default (`placement.internal:50051`, unreachable from a dev
machine) — that is the correct, expected behaviour, not a failure:

```bash
cd packages/engine
npx vitest run src/scheduling/__tests__/placement-integration.test.ts
```

### Stop it when you're done

This is a plain foreground (or backgrounded) process on your machine, not a
container — nothing stops it for you, and a copy left listening on `:50051`
is stale the moment you next edit `src/placement/**`: a later run (yours, or
someone else's) that dials `localhost:50051` reaches that stale process and
reports a false green against code that has since changed, which is worse
than a connection refused. `Ctrl-C` the foreground terminal, or if you
backgrounded it:

```bash
kill %1                     # if it's a job in the current shell, or:
lsof -t -i :50051 | xargs kill

# confirm the port is free before trusting your next run:
lsof -t -i :50051            # prints nothing once it's actually down
```

If `lsof -t -i :50051` prints a PID *before* you start your own server, that
port is already occupied by something else's process — do not assume it is
safe to reuse; find out whose it is first.
