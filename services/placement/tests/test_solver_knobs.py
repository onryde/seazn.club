"""The solver knobs are READ FROM THE ENVIRONMENT, and a solve says what it did.

THIS FILE IS THE REGRESSION TEST FOR A REAL PRODUCTION INCIDENT, 2026-08-10.

`NUM_SEARCH_WORKERS` was set in `fly.toml`'s `[env]` and had **no effect
whatsoever**: it was a hardcoded module constant, and `config.py` read only
PLACEMENT_SERVICE_SECRET / _MAX_WORKERS / _WALL_SECONDS_MAX / _PORT. Four
production deploys were then spent varying the wall (10s -> 30s) and the
machine (shared-cpu-2x -> performance-8x/16gb) while the one variable everybody
believed was being tuned never moved off 8. Every run returned a byte-identical
board.

A knob that silently does nothing is worse than no knob: it makes an experiment
look conclusive when it never ran.

--- what changed under this file, and why the shape of the tests changed too ---

The knobs were first made settable by turning them into `os.environ.get(...)`
module constants in `model.py`. That fixed the incident and broke the layering:
`_RULES.md` §2.1 forbids `os.environ` in the domain. They now live as a
`SolverKnobs` VALUE — defaults in the domain, environment read in `config.py`,
joined in `main.py` — so these tests no longer reload modules to observe an
import-time read. Nothing here monkeypatches a module attribute and asserts it
changed; that shape passes even when nothing ever reads the environment, which
is exactly the vacuity this file exists to prevent.

The chain has four links and each one is asserted separately, because the
incident was a break at ONE of them with the other three intact:

    environment -> Settings -> SolverKnobs -> CpSolver.parameters

and the last test walks the whole chain through the real servicer, which is
the only assertion that fails if `main.py` builds the knobs correctly and then
forgets to pass them to `solve()`. That failure mode is live: `solve(model,
wall_seconds)` still has a default `knobs` argument so domain tests can call it
with two arguments, and a defaulted argument nobody passes is precisely how
2026-08-10 happened the first time.
