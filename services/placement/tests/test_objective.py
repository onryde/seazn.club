"""T0->T5 lexicographic objective chain — acceptance tests.

Same board as `test_model.py` (`placement_bench_boards.production_board()`, the
shared generator) and the same "nothing is mocked" stance: a green run here
means CP-SAT actually proved six successive optima on the real board.

THE CHAIN IS SIX RUNGS as of 2026-08-13:
`placed -> days -> day_span -> day_start -> idle_gap -> imbalance`. The single
whole-board `makespan` term was RETIRED, not renamed; the rungs that replaced
it are covered here for the production board and in `test_day_objective.py`
for their own behaviour on boards built to isolate each one.

WHAT THESE TESTS HAVE TO PIN, and why the obvious assertions do not do it.
`tiers_completed == TIER_COUNT` plus the tier NAMES is satisfied by a chain
that computes a single weighted score and reports six numbers off it — which is
precisely the thing the design forbids (build.ts's D3: `placed` dominates
absolutely; a shorter day must never be bought by dropping a match). So the
ordering is pinned three further ways, each of which fails if a freeze is
removed:

  * `test_full_chain_places_exactly_what_t0_alone_places` — the T0 floor.
    Without `placed >= floor`, the rungs below it minimise their terms by
    placing almost nothing (an empty board uses no days and spans nothing), so
    the count collapses.
  * `test_reported_bounds_are_frozen_against_the_final_board` — the T1 and T2
    ceilings. The board that comes back is the LAST rung's, several solves
    after `days`/`day_span` reported theirs; if those values were not frozen as
    constraints, the rungs below are free to blow straight through them.
  * `test_reported_values_match_the_board_that_came_back` — the reported
    numbers describe THIS board, not some intermediate one.

The metric re-computations below are deliberately independent of the model's
own objective terms — plain Python over `outcome.assignments`, the way
`test_model.py` re-verifies the constraint families and the way TS's
`boardMetrics` does it for the z3 walk. That is the point: an objective term
that has drifted from the metric it claims to measure is invisible to any
assertion phrased in terms of the term itself.

--- THIS SUITE IS WALL-CLOCK SENSITIVE. Read before calling a red one a bug --

`test_every_tier_completes_on_production_board` asserts six PROVED optima at
`CHAIN_WALL_SECONDS`. Measured over 6 runs, that chain costs 7.7-19.5 s
(median 17.7 s: placed 255 ms, days 367 ms, day_span 1 237 ms, day_start
396 ms, idle_gap 14 931 ms, imbalance 321 ms) — `idle_gap` is essentially the
whole cost, and it is the rung that got dearer, not the new ones.

That cost is REPORTED, not hidden. Before the day rungs the same chain proved
four tiers in 1.1-2.1 s. The control run that explains it: `placed` +
`idle_gap` alone, with no day rungs at all, costs 12.4 s — so the old
whole-board `makespan` freeze had been doing `idle_gap`'s pruning for it, and
retiring the term is what the wall pays for. Not a defect in the new rungs;
they cost ~2 s of the total between them.

The solver takes eight search workers on a six-core machine, so a box already
running other agents stretches those numbers past the wall and the chain
reports fewer rungs than it can prove alone. That is the budget working exactly as
designed (it under-reports rather than claiming an unproved optimum) and it is
NOT a regression in the tier code.

Observed here: identical code, two consecutive runs, `tiers_completed` 4 then
2, with `load average: 7.5`. This repo has a documented family of these
(`repair-scale` termination-under-budget, `roundrobin` idempotence, `swiss`
colour bounds — all green alone, all tripped by concurrent agents). Check the
load before diagnosing, and re-run alone.

If a tier ever needs to get genuinely faster, the lever is its DUAL bound, not
its search — see `placement.model`'s T3 note, where a squeeze that could not close
its bound in 20 s proved the same value in 0.4 s as an equality.

--- round 6: identity is POSITIONAL, `bench/` is not ------------------------

`bench/placement_bench_boards.py` is out of scope and still returns string-keyed
boards; `_board_positional.to_positional` converts every board generated in
this file immediately, before it ever reaches `build_model`. `objective.py`
itself is untouched by round 6 — it never keys on identity at all, only on
`FixtureVars`'s decision variables.

# --- the proved optima of `production_board()` ------------------------------
#
# These are not observations of a run, they are PROVED lexicographic optima of
# a deterministic model, so each is a single exact value: a chain that reaches
# `TIER_COUNT` means CP-SAT proved there is no better one. That is what makes them safe to
# assert with `==`, and asserting them with `==` is the point — every existing
# assertion on these three numbers is one-sided in the SAFE direction
# (`recomputed <= reported`), which a WORSE value satisfies more easily. A
# chain that actively MAXIMISES player idle time therefore shipped green
# through four review rounds: inverting T2 moves the reported gap from
# 132 600 000 ms to 2 229 000 000 ms — 16.8x worse, the metric an organiser
# feels most directly — with the suite 14/14.
#
# If a deliberate board change moves these, `tests/test_bench_contract.py`

# without reading that test's failure.
#
# RE-BASELINED 2026-08-13 — T1 IS NOW THREE RUNGS, NOT ONE. The single
# whole-board `makespan` term (`mk_hi - mk_lo`) was RETIRED and replaced by
# `days` -> `day_span` -> `day_start`; see `placement.model`'s T1 section for
# why a whole-board span on a multi-day board is mostly measuring darkness.
# The retired constants and their history, kept so a future reader can tell a
# re-baseline from a drift:

    Why it has to exist (#511): pins now bound `mk_lo`/`mk_hi` directly rather

    T1's search. T1 used to take upwards of 2 260 ms to prove and now takes
    ~450-670 ms — but the number that matters is not the speedup, it is that
    the window between "T1 has found an incumbent" and "T1 has proved it" has
    closed. Measured 8 runs per wall, counting the state these tests actually
    need (`tiers_completed == 1` AND two objective values):

        0.20 s -> 0/8   T1 returns NOTHING; one objective value, not two

    DISCARDED... adopting it would replace a proved board with an unproved
    one"). That rationale conflated two claims. The adopted board satisfies
    every frozen bound as a HARD CONSTRAINT, so it is proved on the earlier
    tiers' metrics exactly as the discarded board was; the only thing unproved
    about it is that its OWN metric is minimal, which `tiers_completed == 4`
    already says. Measured cost of the old rule on this board and this wall,

    relaxation variables: 1 812 000 000 -> 170 400 000, 6/6 (see
