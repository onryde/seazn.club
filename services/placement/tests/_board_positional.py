"""Adapter: bench's STRING-shaped board tuples -> the service's POSITIONAL
(int-indexed) shape, after round 6's identity redesign.

`bench/placement_bench_boards.py` is out of scope for round 6 (see
`services/placement/src/placement/model.py`'s module docstring, "THE BENCH HAS ITS
OWN COPY OF THIS MODEL") and still returns `placement.model.build_model`'s
PRE-round-6 parameter shape: string fixture ids, string court names, string
division/entrant ids -- exactly what `proto/scheduler.proto`'s
`SolveBuildRequest` could carry before this round. This module is the one
place that bridges the two, so every acceptance test that drives a bench
board keeps using the bench's ONE generator (the whole reason Prompt 02
extracted it into `placement_bench_boards.py`) without every test re-deriving its
own id -> index mapping by hand.

Identity is assigned by FIRST APPEARANCE, in traversal order: a fixture's new
identity is its position in `fixtures` (the OLD `fixture_id` string is simply
discarded, exactly as a real caller's would be under the new contract); a
court's is its position in the OLD `courts` list; division/entrant identity
is assigned by first appearance while walking `fixtures` in order. This is
stable across calls because the bench's board generators build their lists
deterministically (no set iteration anywhere in the traversal), so the
adapter itself introduces no nondeterminism on top of the solver's own.
