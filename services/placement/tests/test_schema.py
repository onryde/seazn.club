"""The wire boundary, both directions: proto in via `request_to_model_input`,
proto out via `outcome_to_response` / `error_response`.

This is the anti-corruption layer. Domain code (`placement.model` /
`placement.objective`) never sees a proto type in either direction, and — the
point of most of the tests below — never sees a request that would make it
produce a confidently wrong board. `build_model` and `run_tier_chain` keep
their own guards on the same two scalar fields; those are defence in depth,
not the first line. Rejecting here is what turns the failure into a clean
`SOLVE_STATUS_ERROR` response instead of an exception escaping the handler.

--- round 6: identity is POSITIONAL ------------------------------------------

`_require_id` and its three-round character-canonicality saga (whitespace,
invisible Unicode, homoglyphs) are gone along with every test that exercised
them — there is no id left to canonicalise. In their place: every index must
be IN RANGE for the list or count it points into, and every SINGULAR index
field must be explicitly SET (0 is always a legitimate index, so an unset
field cannot be told from a deliberate 0 by value alone). See `placement.schema`'s
module docstring for the full reasoning.

# whitespace, reject invisible Unicode, and were about to try rejecting
# homoglyphs when the pattern was recognised — every character rule is a
# guess about what a caller MEANT by two strings that render identically, and
# the guessing never terminates. The service was never actually misbehaving:
# given two distinct strings it saw two courts and placed one fixture on
# each, correctly. Now that court identity is POSITIONAL, "two distinct
# strings" and "two distinct entities" are the same fact, and there is
# nothing left to reject.
#
# Small boards (2 fixtures, 2 courts), never the production board — per the
# brief. N=6 per `_RULES.md` section 6b: the solver is nondeterministic, so a
# single run is a sample, not an observation.
