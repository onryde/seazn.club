"""The T0->T3 lexicographic objective chain.

T0 max-placed -> T1 makespan -> T2 worst idle gap -> T3 court imbalance, in
that fixed order. The order is a protocol constant shared with the TS side,
not wire data (design spec, "Tier/objective semantics are a fixed protocol
constant"), and it encodes a product ruling: `placed` dominates absolutely.
A shorter day, a tighter idle gap or a flatter court load must NEVER be
bought by dropping a match an organiser asked to fit. `build.ts:1577-1585`
records that the trade was re-affirmed against measurement, not chosen in
ignorance of it — the sweep showed the lower three metrics getting WORSE when
one more match fits, and that is the tiers working, not a defect.

This is a port of `bench/placement_bench.py`'s `run_full_chain`, which is itself
the sequential-solve port of z3's bound walk in `build.ts:1602-1672`.

--- the mechanism, and how it differs from both of its ancestors ------------

z3 (build.ts) walks each tier DOWNWARD: `push()`, assert `metric <= best-1`,
`check()`, `pop()`, repeat until UNSAT proves `best` optimal, then assert
`metric <= best` at the top level so every later tier inherits it. CP-SAT has
native optimisation, so one `Minimize` + one `Solve` replaces the whole walk
and returns the proved optimum directly.

That collapses the push/pop question rather than answering it. `push`/`pop`
exist in the z3 version because the walk asserts bounds it intends to RETRACT
(`best-1` is a question, and an UNSAT answer must not stay in the solver).
Nothing here is ever retracted: the only assertion this module adds is a
tier's ACHIEVED value, which build.ts adds at the top level too, outside every
push. So the accumulated bounds are monotone and one `CpModel` carries them
all — `model.Add(...)` here is exactly `build.ts:1670`'s
`tier.atMost(tier.of(incumbentMetrics))`, and it has no `pop` for the same
reason that line does not.

Differing from the BENCH: `run_full_chain` REBUILDS the model per tier and
passes the previous tiers' bounds into `build_model` as `placed_floor` /
`makespan_ceiling` / `idlegap_ceiling` constructor arguments. That is a
benchmark measuring build cost per tier; there is no reason to pay it four
times in the service. One model is built once (`placement.model.build_model`,
which deliberately sets NO objective for this reason) and this module drives
it through four objectives. `model.Maximize`/`Minimize` REPLACES the objective
rather than adding to it, so the tiers do not blend — verified, not assumed:
`test_full_chain_places_exactly_what_t0_alone_places` fails if they do.

--- what `tiers_completed` means, and why FEASIBLE does not count -----------

`SolveBuildResponse.tiers_completed` is specified as "same semantics as
`BuildResult.tiersCompleted`" (design spec). On the TS side that counter is
incremented ONLY for a tier that settled — one that ran to a verdict rather
than to the budget (`build.ts:1669-1671`: `if (!settled) break;`). An
`unknown` verdict explicitly does not count; the header is emphatic that the
absence of a proof must never be read as one.

CP-SAT's equivalent of "settled" is `OPTIMAL`. `FEASIBLE` means the time limit
fired before the solver could prove optimality — it is the `unknown` case
wearing a friendlier name, because CP-SAT hands back its incumbent instead of
nothing. So:

  * a tier counts only when it returns OPTIMAL, and
  * the first non-OPTIMAL tier ENDS the chain, exactly as `!settled` does.

Under-reporting is safe (TS runs LNS it did not strictly need); over-reporting
is not — `tiersCompleted === TIER_COUNT` is the sole gate on TS's
`already_optimal` claim (`build.ts:1863`) and on skipping LNS entirely.

--- why a cut-short tier's board is ADOPTED rather than discarded -----------

REVERSED 2026-08-10, by measurement. This module originally discarded it, and
that decision was reasoned rather than measured. What the reasoning missed is
recorded below, because the argument still LOOKS right.

The old argument: a FEASIBLE board satisfies every frozen bound, so it is no
worse on any EARLIER tier's metric — but its own tier's metric may be worse
than the board already in hand, and there is no honest way to check from here,
because `makespan` and `worst_gap` are ONE-SIDED terms. `mk_lo <= start[i]` and
`mk_hi >= start[i] + dur` squeeze the makespan onto the true extremes only
because something is minimising the difference; `worst_gap`'s per-pair
variables are likewise only bounded from below. Each reads true ONLY for the
tier optimising it; anywhere else `solver.Value()` returns arbitrary slack.
(That part is still true and still matters — the bench records all four
numbers on every tier row and some of them are meaningless. `placed` and,
since the T3 encoding became a max/min EQUALITY, `imbalance` read true
everywhere.) Re-deriving the other two in Python would be a second
implementation of what the model already states, which is the placer/verifier
fork this repo keeps getting bitten by.

What that reasoning never established is that the risk it guards against
actually occurs — and it does not. Measured over 6 runs per arm on two boards,
comparing the incumbent against the adopted board WITHIN one run (the only
comparison that means anything; two arms are two different solves): 0
regressions. What the old rule cost, every time, was the better board. True
span read off the assignments: 130 800 000 -> 79 200 000 (-39%) on a 2-day
board, -24% on a 3-day, -22% on an 8-day, 1 557 600 000 -> 1 519 800 000 on
the bench production board.

That cost is not occasional. On a real multi-day board T1 essentially never
proves — the model hands CP-SAT no counting relation between the makespan
window and how many fixtures must fit it, so the dual bound starts at 0 and
has to be walked up by branching. A 2-day board of 304 variables and 575
constraints does not close in 15 s, and neither does a hand-fed floor within
4% of the optimum. So "the tier was cut short" is the NORMAL path for T1, not
the edge case, and discarding its board meant an organiser reliably received
T0's.

Adopting is sound for the reason the old argument half-stated: every earlier
bound is a hard constraint in this model, so the adopted board is proved on
those metrics exactly as the incumbent was. The one unproved thing about it is
that its own metric is minimal — which `tiers_completed` not counting it says
already, and which `schema.py`'s `objective_values[:tiers_completed]` slice
keeps off the wire.

A solution hint was the obvious way to make the guarantee airtight rather than
merely observed, and it was measured too, over the same 6 runs per arm. It is
NOT used: the regression count was 0 either way, and hinting cost search
quality — one hinted run returned 80 400 000 where six unhinted runs returned
79 200 000, and under load the hinted arm proved fewer tiers. Note also that a
hint over `placed` and `start` alone is INCOMPLETE ("37 out of 187 non fixed
variables hinted"); the court booleans are needed too, so the cheap version of
this idea does not even carry the guarantee it appears to.

T0 still adopts whatever the status, for its own separate reason: there is no
incumbent to fall back on. That mirrors TS returning its greedy board with
`tiersCompleted: 0`.
