"""The anti-corruption layer between the wire and the domain.

This module is the ONLY place a proto message is read, and the ONLY place a
plain-Python solve result is turned back into one — both directions, one file.
`placement.model` and `placement.objective` are written against tuples, dicts and
floats and must never import `scheduler_pb2`; `placement.main` orchestrates
(authenticate, translate in, compute, translate out) but holds no domain logic
and constructs no proto message of its own. That boundary is the design's, not
a style preference — it is what lets the solver be tested, benched and reasoned
about without a gRPC runtime.

It is also where degenerate requests are rejected. Proto3 has no way to say
"absent" for a non-optional scalar or for a message field, so a field the
caller simply failed to set arrives as `0` / empty and is indistinguishable
from a deliberate zero — and each of the four below makes the solver return a
confidently WRONG board with a healthy-looking status rather than an error:

  * `constraints.match_minutes == 0` — zero-width intervals, so NoOverlap
    constrains nothing and every fixture stacks on one tick. OPTIMAL.
  * a division's `max_fixtures_per_day` of `0` — that division may not be
    placed at all, and the solve reports OPTIMAL having dropped all of its
    fixtures.
  * `wall_seconds == 0` — the tier chain stops before T0, returning UNKNOWN
    with no assignments, which is exactly what an impossible board returns.
  * `slots` empty — every fixture is forced onto tick 0, and one fixture per
    court is placed and proved OPTIMAL while the rest are silently dropped.
    Measured through the real server: 8 fixtures, 2 courts, no slots -> a
    board proved OPTIMAL, `error` unset, most fixtures silently unplaced.

`build_model` and `run_tier_chain` guard the first two themselves and raise
`ValueError`. Those guards stay: they protect the bench and any future caller.
But the wire is where the mistake is actually made, so it is caught here first
and as an `InvalidRequestError`, which `placement.main` turns into a
`SOLVE_STATUS_ERROR` response carrying the reason — a well-formed answer the
caller can act on, rather than an exception crossing the RPC boundary.

--- round 6: identity is POSITIONAL, and `_require_id` is gone -------------

`_require_id` went through three rounds of character rules — whitespace,
then invisible Unicode, then homoglyphs — and never terminated, because every
rule was a guess about what a caller MEANT by two strings that render
identically. The service never actually misbehaved: given two distinct
strings it saw two courts and placed one fixture on each, correctly. The
wrongness only ever appeared when a human rendered the board — and this
context never renders (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-07-placement-service-
prompts/_RULES.md` section 1: this is a PLACER only). So the fix is not a
fourth character rule; it is to stop comparing strings at all.

A fixture's identity is its position in `fixtures`. A court's is its position
in `court_names`. A division's or entrant's identity is a caller-assigned
index, bounded by a declared count (`division_count` / `entrant_count`)
rather than inferred from the largest index actually used — an inferred
bound cannot distinguish "entrant 7" from a typo, a declared one can.

In `_require_id`'s place, ONE rule, in two parts:

  * every index must be IN RANGE for the list or count it points into.
    Out-of-range is a hard reject naming the field, the value, and the bound.
  * every SINGULAR (non-repeated) index field must be explicitly SET. Proto3
    has no way to say "absent" for a non-optional scalar, and 0 is always a
    legitimate index — so without presence tracking, a caller who forgot to
    set (say) `Fixture.division_index` would silently join division 0's
    rest/cap rules rather than being refused. That is the SAME "unset vs.
    legitimately zero" trap `gap_minutes` and `Slot.day_index` already close
    with proto3 `optional`, applied to every field whose entire job is naming
    one specific entity. `entrant_indices` is exempt from this second part —
    it is REPEATED, and a repeated field's elements carry no presence
    ambiguity of their own: every element that exists was explicitly
    appended, so only its range is checked.

`tests/test_schema.py`'s completeness gate enumerates every `uint32` field
straight out of `SolveBuildRequest.DESCRIPTOR` and asserts each one either
reaches `_require_index_range` (and, where singular, `_require_index_present`)
or sits on a named exemption list — the same shape `_require_id`'s gate had,
retargeted from string fields to index fields.

Two things this rule does NOT need to reproduce from the string contract,
because the defect they closed cannot occur positionally any more:

  * canonicality ("is this the same id as that one, once whitespace/invisible
    characters/homoglyphs are accounted for") — there is no id to canonicalise.
  * `courts` uniqueness/blankness — `court_names` is now display-only, never
    compared, never required unique. Two entries that render identically are
    simply two distinct, correctly-disambiguated indices.

Most of what the old referential-integrity pass enforced — a pinned row on a
court nobody declared, a dependency naming an unresolvable fixture, a rule
naming an undeclared division — survives, now as a range check instead of a
dict-membership check. `model.py`'s own tolerance of an out-of-range index
(skip rather than crash) is UNCHANGED, for the same reason it was unchanged
in the string contract: the wire is where the mistake is caught, not the
domain, and moving the check there would take away the domain's own ability
to be fed a partial board directly (by tests, or any future caller).

--- task C2: the per-court coverage refusal is GONE, not renamed --------------

Two shapes used to be refused here by `_validate_court_slot_coverage`, which
no longer exists: a court declared without slots, and courts offering
different tick sets from one another. Both were a REFUSAL standing in for a
missing capability — `model.py` unioned every court's admissible starts into
one shared domain, so a per-court blackout could not be expressed and the
whole request was bounced back to the caller's own greedy fallback instead of
risking a fixture placed on a tick its court never actually offered.

`model.py` now enforces each court's own tick set directly (see its
docstring, "per-court grids"), so neither shape needs a refusal any more —
one is simply modelled correctly (a per-fixture domain restriction, court by
court), and the other (a court no slot mentions at all — a legitimate way to
configure a court blacked out for the whole horizon) is handled by forcing
that court's `presence_court[i][c]` to 0 for every fixture, in the domain,
rather than by rejecting the request at the ACL. The RULE survives; only the
REFUSAL does not.

--- #21: rule_groups / PinnedRow.rule_group_indices / PinnedRow.entrant_indices --

Three more fields this module owns: C1/C4/C6 of the contract revision that
generalises `division_rules` past a division-only scope. `RuleGroup` is a rule
and the exact MOVABLE fixture set it binds — the caller resolves any scope
(competition, division, pool, entrant, person) via its own `scopeCoversFixture`
and sends the RESULT, so this service still never learns what a division, pool,
entrant or person IS (`_RULES.md` section 1). `PinnedRow.rule_group_indices` is
which of those groups a pin counts against, and `PinnedRow.entrant_indices` is
who is playing in it.

All three are parsed and validated here exactly like every other field in this
module — every index in range, every value where "unset" and "legitimately
zero" could collide presence-tracked — and, like every other validated field,
they land on `ModelInput`. What happens next has PARTIALLY changed since this
was first written: task C4 taught `build_model` to enforce a rule group's DAY
CAP (`max_fixtures_per_day`) against the fixtures and pins it covers, so
`main.py` now calls `build_model` with NINE positional arguments, not seven —
`rule_groups` and `pinned_rule_group_indices` join the original seven.
`pinned_entrant_indices` is still not among them: C6 (participant rest, keyed
by a pin's entrants) and C1's `min_rest_minutes` half of `rule_groups` remain
separate, later tasks, and `build_model` does not read either yet. See
`placement.model`'s own module docstring ("A FIFTH is CLOSED as of task C4")
for the day-cap half's mechanics.
