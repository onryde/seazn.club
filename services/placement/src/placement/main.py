"""The gRPC server: bootstrap, auth, health, and the SolveBuild handler.

Application/infrastructure layer. It orchestrates and nothing else: it
authenticates, asks `placement.schema` to translate the request into domain types,
asks the domain (`build_model` / `solve`) to compute, and asks `placement.schema`
to translate the plain-Python outcome back onto the wire. It decides nothing
about scheduling and — deliberately — constructs no proto message itself. Both
directions of the translation live in the one anti-corruption layer, which is
why this module imports `scheduler_pb2_grpc` (the generated servicer base and
its registration helper) but never `scheduler_pb2`.

Sync `grpcio` with a `ThreadPoolExecutor`, not `grpc.aio`: a solve is a
CPU-bound OR-Tools call that never yields, so an event loop buys nothing. Auth
is a shared secret on request metadata, not mTLS — 6PN is already
WireGuard-encrypted, and cert rotation would be cost against a threat model
nothing else in this repo defends against.

--- the health check gets its own threads, and solves are admission-controlled

An earlier version of this docstring justified the thread pool partly on the
grounds that an event loop "would starve the health check". The chosen
topology starved it too, and the claim is exactly why nobody looked: a comment
asserting a bug is absent is how the bug survives the next review.

Measured over a real port with `solve` replaced by a sleep, so solver speed was
not a variable:

    max_workers   health, idle       health, pool saturated (2 s deadline)
    1             SERVING in 0.003s  DEADLINE_EXCEEDED after 2.005s
    4 (default)   SERVING in 0.002s  DEADLINE_EXCEEDED after 2.004s

One `grpc.server` carried both servicers on one bounded pool, so `max_workers`
in-flight solves left no thread to answer `Health/Check`. With the shipped
defaults that is a ~10 s liveness blackout — long enough for a platform probe
to kill the machine MID-SOLVE, taking every in-flight solve with it. It is
self-reinforcing under load: the kill drops capacity, which saturates the
replacement faster.

Two changes, and both are needed:

  * the pool is `max_workers + HEALTH_RESERVE_THREADS`, so threads exist that
    a solve can never occupy. `PLACEMENT_MAX_WORKERS` now means CONCURRENT SOLVES
    rather than pool size.
  * `SolveBuild` takes a slot from a bounded semaphore and refuses at once
    with `SOLVER_BUSY` when there is none. Reserved threads alone would fill
    with QUEUED solves, and a queued caller waits out a deadline it was always
    going to miss — `build.ts` can fall back on its own placer given a reason,
    and can do nothing with an answer that arrives after it gave up.

One server on one port, deliberately: a second server for health would need a
second port in the deploy, and the reserve achieves the same isolation without
one.
